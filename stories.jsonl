The porter faithfully does his job, keeping out all who would disturb the peace of the monastery.\n\nHowever, one Easter Eve, the porter allows a sick old man and other needy individuals into the monastery, saying that it is the will of God. The monks are forced to put aside their prayer and contemplation to tend to the needs of these people. They are surprised to find that, in doing so, they are fulfilling their prayers more than ever before.\n\nThe story ends with the old abbot feeling the beat of wings, knowing that his time has come to meet his Master in heaven.\n\nStory so far:  The passage describes the sound that God most loves to hear: the sound of people working hard.

The speaker has kept the Abbot's gate this Easter Eve and now the Abbot's house shines like a star to show the Angels where God's children are.

Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.\n\nLater, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information.

His mother taught him how to run and play in the woods, and he would often chatter like a squirrel to his friends. A teacher is talking to her assistant about a naughty student.

He sets off for the carrot patch one night, but is waylaid by Jimmy Rabbit, who is busy eating cabbages. Jimmy reluctantly shows Nimble to the carrot patch, and then scampers off.\n\nNimble is disappointed to find that carrots are not as tasty as he was led to believe. He starts to leave the patch, but is pursued by Jimmy Rabbit, who is being chased by a dog. Nimble and Jimmy lose each other in the woods, and Nimble goes home empty-handed.\n\nThe next day, Nimble's mother scolds him for not digging up the carrots to eat them, and he realizes his mistake.

And he is glad--because he does not want to meet him until Mr. Crow comes.\n\nAt last Jasper leaves his hiding place and flies beyond the barn, where he alights on the fence, to meet Mr. Crow. And very promptly the old gentleman arrives. He brought ten of his relations with him, too--all noisy and unmannerly fellows.\n\n\"Here we are!\" cried Mr. Crow. \"We've come to see you whip the person with the loud voice and drive him out of the valley.\" And all ten of his relations joined Mr. Crow in a loud, cackling laugh.\n\n\"What's the joke?\" asked Jasper Jay.\n\n\"Oh, there's no joke at all--yet,\" said Mr. Crow.
