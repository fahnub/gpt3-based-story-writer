Blue Beard noticed that his wife was acting strangely and asked her why the key to his closet was not with the other keys. She said she must have left it upstairs and he told her to bring it to him. When she gave it to him, he noticed a stain on it and asked her how it got there. She said she didn't know and he became very angry.
