The Wag is a court jester who is known for his droll sense of humor. The King is very fond of him and gives him many presents, including a horse. However, when the Wag leaves, he mounts the horse backwards, facing the tail. When the King asks him why he is doing this, the Wag replies that he wants to see if the King's officers are following him so that he can hand over the presents immediately.
