The little barnacles referred to in the passage are actually a type of clam. They are known for their ability to cling to ships. The barnacles in the passage are singing a song that, according to the mermaid, usually has no meaning. However, the child asks if they write comic operas, to which the mermaid replies that they seem to enjoy the songs they sing.
