Ben, a young boy, is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture. Ben replies that he has driven elephants and camels, ostriches and grizzly bears, and mules, and six yellow ponies all at once, and that he could manage cows if he tried hard. The squire likes him all the better for the droll mixture of indignation and respect in his response.
