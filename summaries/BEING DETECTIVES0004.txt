The passage describes a group of children who are prevented from playing in their garden by a horse-chestnut tree. Dicky climbs to the top of the tree to see if the blinds at the back of the house are down, and they are. The weather is hot and stuffy, so the children make a tent out of a clothes-horse and some blankets.
