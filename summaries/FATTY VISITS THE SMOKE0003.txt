Fatty notices a delicious smell coming from Farmer Green's smokehouse and decides to investigate. He finds that the door is open a little bit and decides to slip inside. It is almost dark inside, but Fatty can see just as well as anyone else can in the daytime. There is a long table inside with all sorts of meats and cheeses laid out on it.
