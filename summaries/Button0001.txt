In the fable, "Button-Bright is Lost and Found Again," the Bumpy Man tells Trot that winter is coming and that it is now snowing hard outside. Trot, who lives in California, has never seen snow before, except far away on the tops of high mountains. The Bumpy Man tells her that this is the top of a high mountain.
