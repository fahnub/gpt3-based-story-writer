Turkey Proudfoot begins to wish for the return of Simon Screecher, and after a short while, Screecher returns. Screecher explains that Solomon Owl says he doesn't want to meet Turkey because he has heard that Turkey is a tough old bird. Turkey denies this, saying that he is very tender and not even ten years old.
