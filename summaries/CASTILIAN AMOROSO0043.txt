The passage describes a confrontation between a young girl and an older woman. The girl, Dora, is part of a group of children who have come to beg for money. The woman is angry and calls them "nasty, sordid little things." Dora responds by saying that they are just as ambitious as the woman's son, who is also trying to make his fortune, but that no one would listen to them if they tried to preach like he does.
