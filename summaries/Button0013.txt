The Ork is scornful of birds, calling them "dreadful creatures" covered in feathers. Trot disagrees, saying she thinks they're beautiful. The Ork gets angry and goes back into the house. Button-Bright tries to catch one of the birds, but it's too strong and nearly carries him away. He lets go and the bird flies back down.
