Sam's friends are amazed when he calls out "Bulrushes!" in response to a question. When asked what it means, Sam turns sulky. Ben tells the other boys that it is the sign and password of a secret society to which he and Sam belong, and promises to tell them all about it if Sam gives him leave. This mystery causes a lull in the war of the wood-pile.
