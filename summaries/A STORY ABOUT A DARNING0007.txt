The passage describes a conversation between a darning needle and a bit of flax, in which they each express pride in their own origins. The darning needle comes from a work-box belonging to a cook, and is proud of the cook's five fingers, which it sees as a sign of nobility. The bit of flax, meanwhile, comes from a nobleman's coat and is proud of its own origins.
