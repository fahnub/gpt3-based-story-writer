Alice and Dora discuss the meaning of "moral force", which is the ability to influence others through methods such as shaming, mockery, or bribery. Albert-next-door's uncle interrupts and asks them to explain what happened to Albert. Dora says that she is sorry it happened to him, and that she would have preferred it if it had happened to someone else.
