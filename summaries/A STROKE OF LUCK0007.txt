Noisy Jake asked Solomon Owl if he was going to kill any chickens this fall. Jasper Jay was amusing himself by dropping hemlock seeds on Solomon's head. Solomon Owl was thinking deeply and some people claimed that he was not nearly as wise as he looked, but there were some things that he knew just as well as anyone else. Jasper Jay was not aware of that.
