The passage describes how the suitors were so tightly packed that they could not move their arms, and how this was a good thing because otherwise they would have torn each other apart. The country people were standing around the King's throne in thick masses to see the Princess receive the suitors, and as each suitor came into the room their fine phrases went out like a candle. The Princess said it didn't matter and told them to leave.
