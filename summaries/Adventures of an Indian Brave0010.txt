A father and son go for a walk, and the father points out a tree where some pretty new birds are perched high up. The son offers to climb the tree and get the birds for dinner, and the father agrees. But when the son begins to climb, the birds seem to get further and further away, and the ground below looks no bigger than a star. The son tries to go back down, but he can't.
