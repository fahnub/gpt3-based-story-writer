The speaker is saying that it is more likely that the little girl he saw talking to the primroses a few weeks ago was telling lies than the princess he is talking to now. If the little girl were to lie, he says, it would make him doubt his own word. The speaker then says that even though princesses have lied before, he is certain that this particular princess is a good girl, and that she is more than just a princess. In conclusion, the speaker says that Curdie should be sorry for the way he spoke to the princess, and that he should have at least held his tongue.
