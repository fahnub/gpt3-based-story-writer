The passage describes a woman who is visited by the Good Queen in a dream. The Queen tells her to go to her garden, lift up a marble slab, and find a crystal vase filled with a green liquid. The woman is then instructed to put whatever is most on her mind into a bath of roses and rub it with the green liquid.
