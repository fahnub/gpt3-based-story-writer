Crow was not good at arithmetic and was sitting in a pine looking across a cornfield when he saw a small bird disappear into a giant's head. He exclaimed that the bird must have been eaten, but then the bird reappeared and flew away. Old Mr. Crow knew that if the bird could survive inside the giant's head, then he could too.
