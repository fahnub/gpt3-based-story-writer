In this fable, Freddie Firefly asks little Mrs. Ladybug what could happen if the wind blew out his light. Mrs. Ladybug replies that the train would strike him and be wrecked. She explains that she has everything planned for him, and that he will spend his nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the trains.
