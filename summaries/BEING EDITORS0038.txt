This passage describes a law that was passed prohibiting the purchase of gunpowder by anyone under the age of thirteen. The price of the paper was one shilling each, and sixpence extra for the picture of the Malabar going down with all hands. The author and his friend Albert-next-door's uncle attempted to sell one hundred copies of the paper, but only managed to sell two, which was not enough to restore their fortunes.
