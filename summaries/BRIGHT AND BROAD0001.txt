Farmer Green has a pair of oxen, Bright and Broad, who are very different from his pony, Twinkleheels. Bright and Broad are huge and slow-moving, and they never frisk or play like Twinkleheels does. When they do move faster than a walk, they lurch into a strange, shambling swing that makes Twinkleheels giggle.
