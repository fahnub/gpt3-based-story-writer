Turkey Proudfoot is hiding behind a bush, watching a short-necked gentleman with a tail spread out in the same way that Turkey often carries his own tail. Turkey plans to show the stranger a real tail, so he steps out from behind the bush, spreads his tail, and snaps a dry twig beneath his weight. When the stranger hears the noise and turns to look, he briefly has an eager look on his face, but when he sees Turkey Proudfoot, he is no longer interested.
