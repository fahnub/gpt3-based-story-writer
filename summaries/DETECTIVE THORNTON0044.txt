The passage describes a scene in which three people are trying to piece together a torn-up banknote. Two of the fragments have numbers on them, which add up to ten. The third fragment has a letter on it. They are willing to take the note on trust, because they assume that the letter is part of a number. Ben, the person who found the note, is proud that he was able to find the fragments and put them together.
