Alice did not tell her siblings about the light she saw in the neighbor's house the previous night because she did not want to get anyone into trouble, even burglars. However, she decides to tell them now and they all agree to watch the house tonight to see if they see the light again. Noel speculates that the people next door are very grand and won't know them, which could be why the burglars chose their house.
