This passage describes a group of people marching around with gay gowns and summer jackets. The interesting stranger was elected to carry the prize, which was laid out on a red pin-cushion. He did so with great dignity, as he went beside the standard bearer, Cy Fay. They marched all around the place, until they finally halted in the orchard.
