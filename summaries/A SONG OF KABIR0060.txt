The speaker is asking if the person they're talking to heard them singing as they went through the jungle. They mention that they were just out "wooing" and ask if the other person liked the song. They then say that they don't want any of the "Man-Pack" to leave the gates tonight, before asking why they would need the Four if they're just going to kill something.
