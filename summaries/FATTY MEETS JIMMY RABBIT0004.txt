Jimmy Rabbit and his brother are cutting the fur off a gray squirrel's head. Fatty asks how much they charge for a hair-cut, and Jimmy says it depends. If they were cutting Fatty's hair, they would want at least twelve cabbage leaves. Fatty asks if he gets anything for the use of his tail, and the brothers say no.
