Ferdinand Frog and the Turtle family have a disagreement about the quality of the Frogs' singing. Ferdinand insists that the Turtles would appreciate the singing more if they were further away, and Timothy Turtle retorts that the singing couldn't sound any worse than it does up close. In the end, Timothy Turtle goes home, and the Frog family grins broadly.
