The Fable of the Grasshopper and the Ant tells the story of a grasshopper who sings and plays all summer, while the ant works hard to store up food. When winter comes and the grasshopper has nothing to eat, she goes to the ant and asks to borrow some wheat. The ant agrees, on the condition that the grasshopper will repay her when the season comes around.
