Alice and her friend are discussing whether or not it would be cheating to make one bottle of a product nicer than what people would get when they ordered a dozen bottles. Alice argues that it would be quite honest to tell people what they did to make the one bottle nicer, and that the people who ordered the dozen bottles could then do it for themselves.
