Farmer Green never guessed that it was Fatty Coon who was up in the tall chestnut. Fatty had run almost to the woods before he had to take to a tree. If Spot hadn't been quite so close to him, Fatty could have reached the woods and just jumped from one tree to another. But there were no trees near enough the big chestnut for that, so Fatty had to stay and wait for the men to pass.
