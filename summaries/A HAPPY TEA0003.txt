The passage describes three children's reactions to a fancy garden party. Betty is awestruck, Bab is resentful that her enemy Sally is not there to see her, and Ben is self-conscious but happy. A rumbling sound causes the guests to look toward the garden, and they see Miss Celia pushing her brother in a wheelchair.
