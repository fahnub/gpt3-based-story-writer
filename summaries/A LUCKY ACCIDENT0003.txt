Old Ebenezer had been pulling a wagon for many years before Johnnie Green was born. Johnnie tugged on the reins, but Ebenezer continued slowly down the hill. When they reached the bottom, Ebenezer looked at Johnnie as if to say, "I've brought you and your grandma down safely. Now you can get out of the wagon if you want to." Johnnie then jumped out.
