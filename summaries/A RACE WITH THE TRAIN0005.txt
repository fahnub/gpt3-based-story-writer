The passage describes a train making a loud hissing noise, which startled a crow perched in a nearby tree. Two men jumped down from the engine and walked along the track, before crawling back in and continuing on. The crow mused that it must have been angry because it lost to the bird in a race, and decides to come back and race it again tomorrow.
