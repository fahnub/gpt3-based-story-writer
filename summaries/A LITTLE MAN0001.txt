There was a little man who had a little gun. His bullets were made of lead. He went to the brook, saw a little duck, and shot it through the head. He took it home to his wife and told her to make a fire to roast it. Then he went to fetch the drake. The drake was swimming with its curly tail. The little man shot it too.
