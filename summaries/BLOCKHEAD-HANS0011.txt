The passage describes a girl who is looking for her brother in a row of people. She finds him, but he has forgotten the dictionary he used to know by heart. The floor creaks and the ceiling is made of glass mirrors, so he sees himself standing on his head. There are reporters and editors by each window, writing down what is said to publish in a newspaper.
