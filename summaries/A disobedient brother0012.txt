Old Mr. Scott was very angry because the Presbytery made him retire. A friend of his tried to console him by saying that he should be resigned to the will of Providence, but Mr. Scott replied that Providence had nothing to do with it - it was the McCloskeys and the devil who were to blame. Felicity, who was listening to the story, was shocked by Mr. Scott's mention of the devil.
