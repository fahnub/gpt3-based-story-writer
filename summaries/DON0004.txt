Benny Badger and Mr. Fox are talking, and Benny asks Mr. Fox what is clinging to his shoulder. Mr. Fox nervously brushes it off and says it can't be a feather. Benny then exclaims that he said nothing about a feather, but now that Mr. Fox mentions it, perhaps that's what it is. Mr. Fox looks very uncomfortable and says he has to be on his way. Benny then asks Mr. Fox what is on the back of his neck.
