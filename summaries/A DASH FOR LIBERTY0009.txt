Captain Bill and Trot are talking about the Arctic. Captain Bill says that he doesn't like the cold and ice, and that he wouldn't even wear frizzes on his hair. Trot tells him that he doesn't need to worry about that because he doesn't have any hair. The queen and Clia then approach them and tell them that they have decided to allow Captain Bill and Trot to stay in the palace.
