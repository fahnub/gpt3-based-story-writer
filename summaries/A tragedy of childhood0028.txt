This passage describes the difficulties of travelling to California in the 1800s. Young men were often led by a "golden vision" to make the journey, but it was a risky undertaking with no guarantee of success. The captain of one such ship, the brig Fanny, is the focus of the story. His name was Alan Dunbar.
