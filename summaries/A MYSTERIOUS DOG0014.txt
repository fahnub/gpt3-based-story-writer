This passage describes a group of children sitting for a portrait, with their mothers standing nearby. The child at the head of the group is Belinda, who is sitting with her hands neatly folded in her lap. Josephus, the child at the foot of the group, is wearing a new suit of purple and green gingham. He has a straw hat pulled down over his face, obscuring his features.
