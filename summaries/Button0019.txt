Button-Bright is curious about the Ork's tail, and asks to see how it works. The Ork explains that it is his tail and he reserves the right to whirl it himself. Button-Bright then proposes they go out and fly somewhere so he can see how the tail works. The Ork declines, saying he only flies when he is going somewhere.
