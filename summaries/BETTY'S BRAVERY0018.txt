The passage describes a scene in which a young man is about to have a tooth extracted by a dentist. The young man is clearly nervous and Betty, who is presumably a friend or relative, tries to distract herself by reading. However, she is eventually drawn back into the scene by the sounds of Thorny's discomfort.
