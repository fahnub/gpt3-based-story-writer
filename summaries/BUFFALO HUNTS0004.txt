The passage describes how a boy named Johnnie Green came to own a Muley Cow, and how the cow soon learned that Johnnie would always come for her, no matter where she went. The Muley Cow enjoyed making Johnnie work for her, as she felt it was good for him. However, Johnnie did not seem to share this view, and generally tried to avoid work whenever possible.
