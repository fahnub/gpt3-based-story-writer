The passage describes a harness shop in town that the speaker plans to give to Ben on his birthday. Thorny laughs and says that if Ben were to put brown tops on his old boots and stick a cockade in his hat, he would be a happy fellow. The speaker says that those things are out of place in America and would be absurd in a small country place like this.
