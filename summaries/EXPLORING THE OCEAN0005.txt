The passage describes a room in one of Queen Aquareine's palaces, where a long table is laid out with gold dishes and dainty glassware. Around the table are rows of couches for the mermaids to recline on while they eat. Clia explains that only the queen's nobility and favorites are invited to this meal, and that other mermaids have their own tables in different parts of the palace. Trot wonders who will serve the meal.
