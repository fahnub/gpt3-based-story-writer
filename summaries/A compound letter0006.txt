The passage is a letter from Cecily King to her friend Peter, telling him how much she and her friends think of him. She says they were all afraid he was too sick to get better, but she promised to tell him if he did. Cecily says Peter is smart, polite, obliging, hard-working, and a gentleman. She asks him not to mention the pears in his reply.
