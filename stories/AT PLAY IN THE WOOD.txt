AT PLAY IN THE WOOD (Fable, Ages 0 to 3)



Little Red Riding-Hood was not in a hurry, and there were many things to  amuse her in the wood. She ran after the white and yellow butterflies  that danced before her, and sometimes she caught one, but she always let  it go again, for she never liked to hurt any creature.

And then there were the merry, cunning little squirrels to watch,  cracking nuts on the branches of the old trees, and every now and then a  rabbit would hurry away through the tall ferns, or a great bee come  buzzing near her, and she would stop to watch it gathering honey from  the flowers, and wild thyme. So she went on very slowly. By-and-by she  saw Hugh, the woodman. "Where are you going, Little Red Riding-Hood,"  said he, "all alone?"

"I am going to my grand mammaâ€™s," said the child. "Good day; I must make  haste now, for it grows late."
