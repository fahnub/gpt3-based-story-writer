A MATTER OF TASTE (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  "Thank you, dear," said the big black ant,

  "I'd like to go home with you now, but I can't.

  I have to hurry and milk my cows--

  The aphid herds on the aster boughs."

  And the ladybug said: "No doubt it's fine,

  This milk you get from your curious kine,

  But you know quite well it's my belief

  Your cows are best when turned to beef."
