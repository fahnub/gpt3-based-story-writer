"AND THE RAINS DESCENDED AND THE FLOODS CAME (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)

"

  NOW the far waves roll nearer and more near,

  The wind's awake, the pitiless wind's awake,

  It shrieks the menace that I dare not hear,

  Soon at my feet the angry waves will break

  In desolating wrath--and here I stand

  Helpless my house is built upon the sand.



  O you, whose house upon a rock is set,

  Laugh, safe and sure, at threatening wave and wind.

  You chose the better part and yet--and yet,

  There was no other ground that I could find,

  And I was weary and I longed to raise

  A house to guard my shivering nights and days.



  And it was pleasant in the house I made,

  While still the floods and winds were held asleep.

  I blessed it at the dawn, at night I prayed

  As though its dear foundations had been deep

  Sunk in the rock. I whispered in surmise,

  "What if winds never wake, floods never rise?"



  And now the waves are near and very near,

  And here I wait and wonder which may be

  The wave in which my house will disappear,

  My little house that loved and sheltered me,

  Where joy still sings, her garland in her hand,

  Built on the sand, oh God, built on the sand!
