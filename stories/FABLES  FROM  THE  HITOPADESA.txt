The  Despot  and  the  Wag  (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)



A  Despot  in  the  East  wished  to  have  a  great  name  as  a  very  munificent    prince,  so  he  gave  large  presents  to  every  one  of  note  that  came  to  his    court,  but  at  the  same  time  his  officers  had  secret  orders  to  waylay    the  recipients  of  his  gifts  and  recover  them.

In  this  manner  many  a  man  had  been  rewarded  and  plundered.    Once  a  wag    came  to  court,  and  amused  every  one  by  his  drolleries.    The  King  gave    him  a  great  many  presents,  including  a  horse.    After  taking  leave  of    the  King  and  his  courtiers,  the  Wag  bundled  up  the  presents  and  put    them  over  his  shoulders,  and  mounting  the  horse,  facing  the  tail,  was    going  out.    The  King  asked  him  why  he  acted  in  that  manner.

"Sire,"  said  the  Wag,  "simply  to  see  if  your  officers  were  coming    behind,  that  I  may  at  once  hand  over  the  bundle  to  them  and  go  about  my    business."

The  Despot  was  abashed,  and  stopped  giving  any  more  presents,  saying:    "_Giving  is  but  giving  in  vain,  when  we  give  to  take  again_
