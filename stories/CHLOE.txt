CHLOE (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)



  NIGHT wind sighing through the poplar leaves,

  Trembling of the aspen, shivering of the willow,

  Every leafy voice of all the night-time grieves,

  Mourning, weeping over Chloe's pillow.



  Chloe, fresher than the breeze of dawn,

  Fairer than the larches in their young spring glory,

  Brighter than the glow-worms on the dewy lawn,

  Hear the dirge the green trees sing to end your story:--



  "Chloe lived and Chloe loved: she brought new gladness,

  Hope and life and all things good to all who met her;

  Only, dying, wept to know the lifelong sadness

  Willed, against her will, to those who can't forget her."
