AT PARTING (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)



  AND you could leave me now--

  After the first remembered whispered vow

  Which sings for ever and ever in my ears--

  The vow which God among His Angels hears--

  After the long-drawn years,

  The slow hard tears,

  Could break new ground, and wake

  A new strange garden to blossom for your sake,

  And leave me here alone,

  In the old garden that was once our own?



  How should I learn to bear

  Our garden's pleasant ways and pleasant air,

  Her flowers, her fruits, her lily, her rose and thorn,

  When only in a picture these appear--

  These, once alive, and always over-dear?

  Ah--think again: the rose you used to wear

  Must still be more than other roses be

  The flower of flowers. Ah, pity, pity me!



  For in my acres is no plot of ground

  Whereon could any garden site be found,

  I have but little skill

  To water weed and till

  And make the desert blossom like the rose;

  Yet our old garden knows

  If I have loved its ways and walks and kept

  The garden watered, and the pleasance swept.



  Yet--if you must--go now:

  Go, with my blessing filling both your hands,

  And, mid the desert sands

  Which life drifts deep round every garden wall,

  Make your new festival

  Of bud and blossom--red rose and green leaf.

  No blight born of my grief

  Shall touch your garden, love; but my heart's prayer

  Shall draw down blessings on you from the air,

  And all we learned of leaf and plant and tree

  Shall serve you when you walk no more with me

  In garden ways; and when with her you tread

  The pleasant ways with blossoms overhead

  And when she asks, "How did you come to know

  The secrets of the ways these green things grow?"

  Then you will answer--and I, please God, hear,

  "I had another garden once, my dear".
