EN TOUT CAS (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)



  WHEN I am glad I need your eyes

  To be the stars of Paradise;

  Your lips to be the seal of all

  The joy life grants, and dreams recall;

  Your hand, to lie my hands between

  What time we walk the garden green.



  But most in grief I need your face

  To lean to mine in the desert place;

  Your lips to mock the evil years,

  To sweeten me my cup of tears,

  Your eyes to shine, in cloud's despite,

  Your hands to hold mine through the night.
