COMICAL FOLK (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)

    In a cottage in Fife

    Lived a man and his wife

Who, believe me, were comical folk;

    For, to people's surprise,

    They both saw with their eyes,

And their tongues moved whenever they spoke!



    When they were asleep,

    I'm told, that to keep

Their eyes open they could not contrive;

    They both walked on their feet,

    And 'twas thought what they eat

Helped, with drinking, to keep them alive!
