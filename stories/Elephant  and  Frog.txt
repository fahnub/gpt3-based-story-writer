Elephant  and  Frog  (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)



I  often  tell  of  Mr.  Elephant  and  Mr.  Frog,  who  were  courting  at  one    house.

One  day  Mr.  Frog  spake  to  the  sweetheart  of  Mr.  Elephant,  saying:  "Mr.    Elephant  is  my  horse."    Mr.  Elephant,  when  he  came  at  night,  then  the    girls  tell  him,  saying:  "Thou  art  the  horse  of  Mr.  Frog!"

Mr.  Elephant  then  goes  to  Mr.  Frog's,  saying:  "Didst  thou  tell  my    sweetheart  that  I  am  thy  horse?"    Mr.  Frog  says,  saying:  "No;  I  did  not    say  so."    They  go  together  to  find  the  sweetheart  of  Mr.  Elephant.

On  the  way,  Mr.  Frog  told  Mr.  Elephant,  saying:  "Grandfather,  I  have    not  strength  to  walk.    Let  me  get  up  on  thy  back!"    Mr.  Elephant  said:    "Get  up,  my  grandson."    Mr.  Frog  then  goes  up.

When  a  while  passed,  he  told  Mr.  Elephant:  "Grandfather,  I  am  going  to    fall.    Let  me  seek  small  cords  to  bind  thee  in  mouth."    Mr.  Elephant    consents.    Mr.  Frog  then  does  what  he  has  asked.

When  passed  a  little  while,  he  told  again  Mr.  Elephant,  saying:  "Let  me    seek  a  green  twig  to  fan  the  mosquitoes  off  thee."    Mr.  Elephant  says:    "Go."    He  then  fetches  the  twig.

Then,  when  they  were  about  to  arrive,  the  girls  saw  them,  and  they  went    to  meet  them  with  shouting,  saying:  "Thou,  Mr.  Elephant,  art  the  horse    indeed  of  Mr.  Frog!"
