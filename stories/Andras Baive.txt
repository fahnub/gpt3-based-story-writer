Andras Baive (Fables Ages 3 to 5)



Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strongand swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could comenear him if they were running races in the summer evenings.The peopleof Vadso were very proud of their champion, and thought that there wasno one like him in the world, till, by-and-by, it came to their earsthat there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp, Andras Baive by name, whowas said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than thebailiff.Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that, and declaredthat if it made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense, why,let them!

The winter was long and cold, and the thoughts of the villagers weremuch busier with wolves than with Andras Baive, when suddenly, on afrosty day, he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso.Thebailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength, and atonce went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of hisvigour.As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boatthat lay upon the shore, and his face shone with pleasure.'That isthe very thing,' laughed he, 'I will make him jump over that boat.'Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge, and they soon settledthe terms of the wager.He who could jump over the boat without somuch as touching it with his heel was to be the winner, and would get alarge sum of money as the prize.So, followed by many of thevillagers, the two men walked down to the sea.

An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play,and to hold the stakes, and Andras, as the stranger was told to jumpfirst.Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand tomark the starting place, he ran forward, with his head well thrownback, and cleared the boat with a mighty bound.The lookers- oncheered him, and indeed he well deserve it; but they waited anxiouslyall the same to see what the bailiff would do.On he came, taller thanAndras by several inches, but heavier of build.He too sprang high andwell, but as he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat.Dead silence reigned amidst the townsfolk, but Andras only laughed andsaid carelessly:

'Just a little too short, bailiff; next time you must do better thanthat.'

The bailiff turned red with anger at his rival's scornful words, andanswered quickly: 'Next time you will have something harder to do.'And turning his back on his friends, he went sulkily home.Andras,putting the money he had earned in his pocket, went home also.

The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along agreat fiord to the west of Vadso.A boy who had met him hastened totell the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off; and thebailiff, disguising himself as a Stalo, or ogre, called his son and hisdog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had metAndras.

Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands, thinking of thenew hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the dayof his lucky jump.He wandered on, his eyes fixed on the sands, sothat he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock, while hechanged himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves.A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself, and looking up hebeheld the mass of wreckage.'Dear me!I may find some use for that,'he said; and hastened down to the sea, waiting till he could lay holdof some stray rope which might float towards him.Suddenly--he couldnot have told why--a nameless fear seized upon him, and he fled awayfrom the shore as if for his life.As he ran he heard the sound of apipe, such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use; and thereflashed into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped theboat: 'Next time you will have something harder to do.'So it was nowreckage after all that he had seen, but the bailiff himself.

It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain, wherethe sun never set, and it was very difficult to get to sleep, Andrashad spent many hours in the study of magic, and this stood him in goodstead now.The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself tobecome the feet of a reindeer, and in this guise he galloped like thewind for several miles.Then he stopped to take breath and find outwhat his enemy was doing.Nothing he could see, but to his ears thenotes of a pipe floated over the plain, and ever, as he listened, itdrew nearer.

A cold shiver shook Andras, and this time he wished himself the feet ofa reindeer calf.For when a reindeer calf has reached the age at whichhe begins first to lose his hair he is so swift that neither beast norbird can come near him.A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all thingsliving.Yes; but not so swift as a Stalo, as Andras found out when hestopped to rest, and heard the pipe playing!

For a moment his heart sank, and he gave himself up for dead, till heremembered that, not far off, were two little lakes joined together bya short though very broad river.In the middle of the river lay astone that was always covered by water, except in dry seasons, and asthe winter rains had been very heavy, he felt quite sure that not eventhe top of it could be seen.The next minute, if anyone had beenlooking that way, he would have beheld a small reindeer calf speedingnorthwards, and by-and-by giving a great spring, which landed him inthe midst of the stream.But, instead of sinking to the bottom, hepaused a second to steady himself, then gave a second spring whichlanded him on the further shore.He next ran on to a little hill wherehe saw down and began to neigh loudly, so that the Stalo might knowexactly where he was.

'Ah!There you are,' cried the Stalo, appearing on the opposite bank;'for a moment I really thought I had lost you.'

'No such luck,' answered Andras, shaking his head sorrowfully.By thistime he had taken his own shape again.

'Well, but I don't see how I am to get to you1' said the Stalo, lookingup and down.

'Jump over, as I did,' answered Andras; 'it is quite easy.'

'But I could not jump this river; and I don't know how you did,'replied the Stalo.

'I should be ashamed to say such things,' exclaimed Andras.'Do youmean to tell me that a jump, which the weakest Lapp boy would makenothing of, is beyond your strength?'

The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words, just as Andrasmeant him to do.He bounded into the air and fell straight into theriver.Not that that would have mattered, for he was a good swimmer;but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries, andtook aim at him.His aim was good, but the Stalo sprang so high intothe air that the arrow flew between his feet.A second shot, directedat his forehead, fared no better, for this time the Stalo jumped sohigh to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger andthumb.Then Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo'shead, and when he sprang up, just an instant too soon, it hit himbetween the ribs.

Mortally wounded as he was, the Stalo was not yet dead, and managed toswim to the shore.Stretching himself on the sand, he said slowly toAndras:

'Promise that you will give me an honourable burial, and when my bodyis laid in the grave go in my boat across the fiord, and take whateveryou find in my house which belongs to me.My dog you must kill, butspare my son, Andras.'

Then he died; and Andras sailed in his boat away across the fiord andfound the dog and boy.The dog, a fierce, wicked-looking creature, heslew with one blow from his fist, for it is well known that if aStalo's dog licks the blood that flows from his dead master's woundsthe Stalo comes to life again.That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seenwithout his dog; but the bailiff, being only half a Stalo, hadforgotten him, when he went to the little lakes in search of Andras.Next, Andras put all the gold and jewels which he found in the boatinto his pockets, and bidding the boy get in, pushed it off from theshore, leaving the little craft to drift as it would, while he himselfran home.With the treasure he possessed he was able to buy a greatherd of reindeer; and he soon married a rich wife, whose parents wouldnot have him as a son-in-law when he was poor, and the two lived happyfor ever after.
