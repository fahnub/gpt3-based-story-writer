Father  "Lime-stick"  and  the  Flower-pecker  (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)



Old  Father  Lime-stick  once  limed  a  tree  for  birds  and  caught  a    Flower-pecker.    He  was  just  about  to  kill  and  eat  it  when  the  bird    cried  out,  "O  Grandfather,  surely  you  are  not  going  to  eat  me?    Why,    flesh,  feathers  and  all,  I  am  no  bigger  than  your  thumb!"    "What!"  said    the  old  man;  "do  you  expect  me  then  to  let  you  go?"    "Yes,"  said  the    bird,  "only  let  me  go,  and  I  will  fetch  you  such  a  talisman  as  never    was--a  Bezoar-stone  as  big  as  a  cocoanut  and  worth  at  least  a    thousand."    Said  the  old  man,  "Do  you  really  mean  it?"    "Really,  I  do,"    replied  the  bird.    "Just  let  me  go,  and  I'll  bring  it  to  you."    Then,    on  being  released,  he  flew  off  and  perched  on  a  tree,  and  began  to    preen  his  feathers,  to  get  rid  of  the  bird-lime.

Presently  the  old  man  said:  "Where  has  that  bird  got  to?    Bird,  where    is  the  Bezoar-stone  you  promised  to  bring  me,  the  one  that  was  worth  at    least  a  thousand?"    "Out-on-you,"  was  the  reply,  "this  is  really  _too_    ridiculous.    Just  think  of  me,  with  my  body  as  big  as  your  thumb,    carrying  a  Bezoar-stone  as  big  as  a  cocoanut!    It  really  is  too  absurd.    Why,  have  I  even  got  the  strength  to  lift  it?"    At  this  the  old  man    held  his  peace.    "Well,"  continued  the  bird,  "you  will  gain  nothing  by    repenting  that  you  set  me  free.    Only  remember  in  future  not  to    undertake  an  affair  quite  out  of  keeping  with  your  own  powers.    Neither    try  to  get  your  arms  round  a  tree  too  big  for  your  embrace,  nor  attempt    to  climb  one  higher  than  your  strength  permits  you."
