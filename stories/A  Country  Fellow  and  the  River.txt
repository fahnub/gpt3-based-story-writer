A  Country  Fellow  and  the  River (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)

A  stupid  Boy,  who  was  sent  to  market  by  the  good  old  woman,  his  Mother,    to  sell  butter  and  cheese,  made  a  stop  by  the  way  at  a  swift  river,  and    laid  himself  down  on  the  bank  there,  until  it  should  run  out.

About  midnight,  home  he  went  to  his  Mother,  with  all  his  market  trade    back  again.

"Why,  how  now,  my  Son?"  said  she.    "What  ill  fortune  have  you  had,  that    you  have  sold  nothing  all  day?"

"Why,  Mother,  yonder  is  a  river  that  has  been  running  all  this  day,  and    I  stayed  till  just  now,  waiting  for  it  to  run  out;  and  there  it  is,    running  still."

"My  Son,"  said  the  good  woman,  "thy  head  and  mine  will  be  laid  in  the    grave  many  a  day  before  this  river  has  all  run  by.    You  will  never  sell    your  butter  and  cheese  if  you  wait  for  that."
