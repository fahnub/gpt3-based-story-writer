Dog  and  the  Kingship  (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)



Mr.  Dog,  they  wanted  to  invest  him  with  the  kingship.    They  sought  all    the  things  of  royalty:  the  cap,  the  sceptre,  the  rings,  the  skin  of    mulkaka.    The  things  are  complete;  they  say:  "The  day  has  come  to    install."

The  headmen  all  came  in  full;  they  sent  for  the  players  of  drum  and    marimba;  they  have  come.    They  spread  coarse  mats  and  fine  mats.    Where    the  lord  is  going  to  sit,  they  laid  a  coarse  mat;  they  spread  on  it  a    fine  mat;  they  set  a  chair  on.    They  say:  "Let  the  lord  sit  down."    He    sat  down.    The  people  begin  to  divide  the  victuals.

He,  Mr.  Dog,  on  seeing  the  breast  of  a  fowl,  greed  grasped  him.    He    stood  up  in  haste;  took  the  breast  of  the  fowl;  ran  into  the  bush.    The    people  said:  "The  lord,  whom  we  are  installing,  has  run  away  with  the    breast  of  the  fowl  into  the  bush!"    The  people  separated.

Mr.  Dog,  who  was  going  to  be  invested  with  the  kingship,  because  of  his    thievery,  the  kingship  he  lost  it.

I  have  told  my  little  tale.    Finished.
