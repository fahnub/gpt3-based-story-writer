AFTER DEATH (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)



  IF we must part, this parting is the best:

  How would you bear to lay

  Your head on some warm pillow far away--

  Your head, so used to lying on my breast?



  But now your pillow is cold;

  Your hands have flowers, and not my hands, to hold;

  Upon our bed the worn bride-linen lies.

  I have put the death-money upon your eyes,

  So that you should not wake up in the night.

  I have bound your face with white;

  I have washed you, yes, with water and not with tears,--

  Those arms wherein I have slept so many years,

  Those feet that hastened when they came to me,

  And all your body that belonged to me.

  I have smoothed your dear dull hair,

  And there is nothing left to say for you

  And nothing left to fear or pray for you;

  And I have got the rest of life to bear:

  Thank God it is you, not I, who are lying there.



  If I had died

  And you had stood beside

  This still white bed

  Where the white, scented, horrible flowers are spread,--

  I know the thing it is,

  And I thank God that He has spared you this.

  If one must bear it, thank God it was I

  Who had to live and bear to see you die,

  Who have to live, and bear to see you dead.



  You will have nothing of it all to bear:

  You will not even know that in your bed

  You lie alone. You will not miss my head

  Beside you on the pillow: you will rest

  So soft in the grave you will not miss my breast.

  But I--but I--Your pillow and your place--

  And only the darkness laid against my face,

  And only my anguish pressed against my side--

  Thank God, thank God, that it was you who died!
