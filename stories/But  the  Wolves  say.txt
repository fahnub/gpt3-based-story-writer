But  the  Wolves  say: (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)



"Allow  us  to  explain,  O  father.    Did  not  you  give  us  leave  to  take  from    the  Sheep  a  trifling  contribution  for  our  pelisses  in  winter?    It  is    only  because  they  are  stupid  sheep  that  they  cry  out.    They  have  only  a    single  fleece  taken  from  each  of  them,  but  they  grumble  about  giving    even  that!"

"Well,  well,"  says  the  Elephant,  "take  care  what  you  do.    I  will  not    permit  any  one  to  commit  injustice.    As  it  must  be  so,  take  a  fleece    from  each  of  them.    But  do  not  take  from  them  a  single  hair  besides."
