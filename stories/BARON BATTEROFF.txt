BARON BATTEROFF (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  The mighty baron, Batteroff,

  Raised a whale in a watering trough.

  When the whale grew large and fat

  He ate the baron's brindle cat.

  But pussy, once inside the whale,

  Began to tickle with her tail.

  This the monster could not stand,

  And spewed her out upon dry land.

  That night, when all was fine as silk

  And she had supped her bread and milk,

  She grinned and told old Batteroff

  How she got the whale to cough.
