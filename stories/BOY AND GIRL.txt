BOY AND GIRL (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)

There was a little boy and a little girl

    Lived in an alley;

Says the little boy to the little girl,

    "Shall I, oh, shall I?"

Says the little girl to the little boy,

    "What shall we do?"

Says the little boy to the little girl,

    "I will kiss you."
