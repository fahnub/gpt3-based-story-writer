FABLES  OF  LA  FONTAINE  (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)



    The  Grasshopper  and  the  Ant

    A  Grasshopper  gay

    Sang  the  summer  away,

    And  found  herself  poor

By  the  winter's  first  roar.

Of  meat  or  of  bread,

Not  a  morsel  she  had!

So  a-begging  she  went,

To  her  neighbour  the  Ant,

    For  the  loan  of  some  wheat,

    Which  would  serve  her  to  eat,

Till  the  season  came  round.

    "I  will  pay  you,"  she  saith,

    "On  an  animal's  faith,

Double  weight  in  the  pound

Ere  the  harvest  be  bound."

    The  Ant  is  a  friend--

    (And  here  she  might  mend)

    Little  given  to  lend.

"How  spent  you  the  summer?"

    Quoth  she,  looking  shame

    At  the  borrowing  dame.

"Night  and  day  to  each  comer

    I  sang,  if  you  please."

    "You  sang!    I'm  at  ease,

For  'tis  plain  at  a  glance,

Now,  ma'am,  you  must  dance."



    The  Swan  and  the  Cook

    The  pleasures  of  a  poultry  yard

Were  by  a  Swan  and  Gosling  shared.

The  Swan  was  kept  there  for  his  looks,

The  thrifty  Gosling  for  the  Cooks;

The  first  the  garden's  pride,  the  latter

A  greater  favourite  on  the  platter.

They  swam  the  ditches,  side  by  side,

And  oft  in  sports  aquatic  vied,

Plunging,  splashing  far  and  wide,

With  rivalry  ne'er  satisfied.

    One  day  the  Cook,  named  Thirsty  John,

    Sent  for  the  Gosling,  took  the  Swan,



In  haste  his  throat  to  cut,



And  put  him  in  the  pot.

    The  bird's  complaint  resounded



In  glorious  melody;

    Whereat  the  Cook,  astounded



His  sad  mistake  to  see,

Cried,  "What!  make  soup  of  a  musician!

Please  God,  I'll  never  set  such  dish  on.

No,  no;  I'll  never  cut  a  throat

That  sings  so  passing  sweet  a  note."

    _'Tis  thus,  whatever  peril  may  alarm  us,

Sweet  words  will  surely  never  harm  us_.
