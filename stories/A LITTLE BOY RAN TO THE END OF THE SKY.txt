A LITTLE BOY RAN TO THE END OF THE SKY (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  A little boy ran to the end of the sky

  With a rag and a pole and a gooseberry pie.

  He cried: "Three cheers for the Fourth of July!"

  With a rag and a pole and a gooseberry pie.

  He saw three little donkeys at play,

  He tickled their noses to make them bray,

  And he didn't come back until Christmas Day--

  With a rag and a pole and a gooseberry pie.
