Belling  the  Cat (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)

A  certain  Cat  that  lived  in  a  large  country  house  was  so  vigilant  and    active  in  the  performance  of  her  duties  that  the  Mice,  finding  their    numbers  grievously  thinned,  held  a  council  with  closed  doors  to    consider  what  they  had  best  do.

Many  plans  had  been  started  and  dismissed,  when  a  young  Mouse,  rising    and  catching  the  eye  of  the  President,  said  that  he  had  a  proposal  to    make  that  he  was  sure  must  meet  with  the  approval  of  all.    "If,"  said    he,  "the  Cat  should  wear  around  her  neck  a  little  bell,  every  step  she    took  would  make  it  tinkle;  then,  ever  forewarned  of  her  approach,  we    should  have  time  to  reach  our  holes.    By  this  simple  means  we  should    live  in  safety  and  defy  her  power."

The  speaker  resumed  his  seat  with  a  complacent  air,  and  a  murmur  of    applause  arose  from  the  audience.

An  old  gray  Mouse,  with  a  merry  twinkle  in  his  eye,  now  got  up  and  said    that  the  plan  of  the  last  speaker  was  an  admirable  one,  but  he  feared    it  had  one  drawback.    He  had  not  told  them  who  should  put  the  bell    around  the  Cat's  neck!
