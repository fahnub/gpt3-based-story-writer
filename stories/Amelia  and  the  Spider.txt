Amelia  and  the  Spider  (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)





The  muslin  torn,  from  tears  of  grief

In  vain  Amelia  sought  relief;

In  sighs  and  plaints  she  passed  the  day,

The  tattered  frock  neglected  lay:

While  busied  at  the  weaving  trade,

A  Spider  heard  the  sighing  maid,

And  kindly  stopping  in  a  trice,

Thus  offered  (gratis)  her  advice:

    "Turn,  little  girl,  behold  in  me

A  stimulus  to  industry;

Compare  your  woes  my  dear,  with  mine,

Then  tell  me  who  should  most  repine;

This  morning,  ere  you'd  left  your  room,

The  chambermaid's  relentless  broom,

In  one  sad  moment  that  destroyed

To  build  which  thousands  were  employed.

The  shock  was  great,  but  as  my  life

I  saved  in  the  relentless  strife,

I  knew  lamenting  was  in  vain,

So  patient  went  to  work  again;

By  constant  work  a  day  or  more

My  little  mansion  did  restore.

And  if  each  tear  which  you  have  shed

Had  been  a  needleful  of  thread,

If  every  sigh  of  sad  despair

Had  been  a  stitch  of  proper  care,

Closed  would  have  been  the  luckless  rent,

Nor  thus  the  day  have  been  misspent."
