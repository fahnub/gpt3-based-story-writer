BOY AND THE SPARROW (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)



A little cock-sparrow sat on a green tree,

And he chirruped, he chirruped, so merry was he;

A naughty boy came with his wee bow and arrow,

Determined to shoot this little cock-sparrow.



"This little cock-sparrow shall make me a stew,

And his giblets shall make me a little pie, too."

"Oh, no," says the sparrow "I won't make a stew."

So he flapped his wings and away he flew.
