ACCESSION (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)



  ONCE I loved, and my heart bowed down,

  Subject and slave, for Love was a King;

  He sat above with sceptre and crown,

  Turning his eyes from my sorrowing.

  The laugh of a god on his lips lay light--

  His lips victorious that mocked my pain,

  And I mourned in the cold and the outer night,

  And my tears and my prayers were vain.



  Now the old spell is over and done,

  Myself I wear the ermine and gold,

  My brows are crowned, I ascend the throne,

  I have taken the sceptre and orb to hold.

  I smile victorious, set far above

  The music of voices that moan and pray,

  My feet are wet with the tears of love,

  And I turn my eyes away.
