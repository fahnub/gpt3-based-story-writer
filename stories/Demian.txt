Demian's  Fish  Soup  (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)



"Neighbour,  light  of  mine  eyes!  do  eat  a  little  more!"

"Dear  neighbour,  I  am  full  to  the  throat."

"No  matter;  just  a  little  plateful.    Believe  me,  the  soup  is  cooked    gloriously."

"But  I've  had  three  platefuls  already."

"Well,  what  does  that  matter?    If  you  like  it,  and  it  does  you  good,    why  not  eat  it  all  up?    What  a  soup  it  is!    How  rich!    It  looks  as  if    it  had  been  sprinkled  with  amber.    Here  is  a  bream;  there  a  lump  of    sterlet.    Take  a  little  more,  dear,  kind  friend.    Just  another    spoonful.    Wife,  come  and  entreat  him!"

Thus  does  Demian  feast  his  neighbour  Phocas,  not  giving  him  a  moment's    breathing  time.

Phocas  feels  the  moisture  trickling  down  his  forehead.    Still  he  takes    the  soup,  attacks  it  with  all  the  strength  he  has  left,  and  somehow    manages  to  swallow  the  whole  of  it.

"That's  the  sort  of  friend  I  like!"  cries  Demian.    "I  can't  bear  people    who  require  pressing.    But  now,  dear  friend,  take  just  this  one  little    plateful  more."

But,  on  hearing  this,  our  poor  Phocas,  much  as  he  liked  fish  soup,    catching  hold  of  his  cap  and  sash,  runs  away  home,  not  once  looking    behind  him.

Nor  from  that  day  to  this  has  he  crossed  Demian's  threshold
