COME OUT TO PLAY (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)

Girls and boys, come out to play,

The moon doth shine as bright as day;

Leave your supper, and leave your sleep,

And come with your playfellows into the street.

Come with a whoop, come with a call,

Come with a good will or not at all.

Up the ladder and down the wall,

A half-penny roll will serve us all.

You find milk, and I'll find flour,

And we'll have a pudding in half an hour.
