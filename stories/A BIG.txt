A BIG, FAT POTATO (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  A big, fat potato lay down on a clod

  In the shade of some burdock and tall goldenrod,

  And he dreamed he were king of the whole garden plot,

  With a palace and throne, and a crown with a lot

  Of jewels and diamonds and gold till it shone

  Like the front of a show when the lights are turned on.

  He had to be minded by all of the plants;

  When he whistled the radishes knew they must dance;

  When he tooted his horn the cucumbers must sing

  To a vegetable crowd gathered round in a ring.

  He made all the cabbages stand in a row

  While a sunflower instructed them just how to grow;

  The bright yellow pumpkins he painted light blue;

  Took the clothes off the scare-crow and made him buy new.

  He strutted and sputtered and thought it was grand

  To be king and commander o'er all the wide land.

  But at last he woke up with an awful surprise

  And found a blind mole kicking sand in his eyes.
