AS I WAS GOING DOWN THE HILL (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  As I was going down the hill

  In front of Missus Knapp's

  I saw the little Knapperines

  All in their winter wraps--

  Purple mitts and mufflers

  And knitted jersey caps.

  As I was coming back again

  In front of Missus Knapp's

  I saw that awful lady

  Give about a dozen slaps

  To every little Knapperine--

  I thought it was, perhaps,

  Because they gathered stickers

  In their knitted jersey caps.
