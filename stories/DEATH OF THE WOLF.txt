DEATH OF THE WOLF (Fable, Ages 0 to 3)





Little Red Riding-Hood threw her arms round the woodman Hugh's neck and  kissed him, and thanked him again and again.

"Oh, you good, kind Hugh," she said, "how did you know the wolf was  here, in time to save me?"

"Well," said Hugh, "when you were gone by, I remembered that a wolf had  been seen about the wood lately, and I thought I would just come after  you and see if you were safe. When we came near grandmother's house Trim  sniffed and ran to the door and whined, and then he pushed it open--you  had not shut it close--and rushed in, and I followed him, and between us  we have killed the wolf."

Then Hugh took the child home, and her mother and father could not thank  him enough for saving Little Red Riding-Hood.
