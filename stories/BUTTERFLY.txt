BUTTERFLY (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  Butterfly, butterfly,

  Sit on my chin,

  Your wings are like tinsel,

  So yellow and thin.

  Butterfly, butterfly,

  Give me a kiss;

  If you give me a dozen

  There's nothing amiss.

  Butterfly, butterfly,

  Off to the flowers,--

  Wee, soulless sprite

  Of the long summer hours.
