A  Matter  of  Arbitration (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)

Two  Cats,  having  stolen  some  cheese,  could  not  agree  about  dividing  the    prize.    In  order,  therefore,  to  settle  the  dispute,  they  consented  to    refer  the  matter  to  a  Monkey.

The  proposed  Arbitrator  very  readily  accepted  the  office,  and,    producing  a  balance,  put  a  part  into  each  scale.    "Let  me  see,"  said    he,  "aye--this  lump  outweighs  the  other";  and  immediately  bit  off  a    considerable  piece  in  order  to  reduce  it,  he  observed,  to  an    equilibrium.    The  opposite  scale  was  now  heavier,  which  afforded  our    conscientious  judge  a  reason  for  a  second  mouthful.

"Hold,  hold,"  said  the  two  Cats,  who  began  to  be  alarmed  for  the  event,    "give  us  our  shares  and  we  are  satisfied."    "If  you  are  satisfied,"    returned  the  Monkey,  "justice  is  not;  a  cause  of  this  intricate  nature    is  by  no  means  so  soon  determined."    Upon  which  he  continued  to  nibble    first  one  piece  then  the  other,  till  the  poor  Cats,  seeing  their  cheese    rapidly  diminishing,  entreated  to  give  himself  no  further  trouble,  but    to  deliver  to  them  what  remained.

"Not  so  fast,  I  beseech  ye,  friends,"  replied  the  Monkey;  "we  owe    justice  to  ourselves  as  well  as  to  you.    What  remains  is  due  to  me  in    right  of  my  office."

Thus  saying,  he  crammed  the  whole  into  his  mouth,  and  with  great    gravity  dismissed  the  court.
