BRIDAL EVE (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)



  GOOD-NIGHT, my Heart, my Heart, good-night--

  Oh, good and dear and fair,

  With lips of life and eyes of light

  And roses in your hair.



  To-morrow brings the other crown,

  The orange blossoms, Sweet,

  And then the rose will be cast down

  With lilies at your feet.



  But in your soul a garden stands

  Where fair the white rose blows--

  God, teach my foolish clumsy hands

  The way to tend my rose.



  That in the white-rose garden still

  The lily may bloom fair

  God help my heart and soul and will

  To keep the lily there.
