ALL ABOARD FOR BOMBAY (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  All aboard for Bombay,

  All aboard for Rome!

  Leave your little sisters

  And your loving aunts at home.



  Bring a bit of bailing wire,

  A pocketful of nails,

  And half a dozen wiener-wursts

  For every man that sails.



  Tell Terry Tagg, when you go by,

  Be sure to bring his dog.

  All aboard for Bombay

  On a floating cedar log!
