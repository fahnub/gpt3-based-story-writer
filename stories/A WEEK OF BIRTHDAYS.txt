A WEEK OF BIRTHDAYS (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)

Monday's child is fair of face,

Tuesday's child is full of grace,

Wednesday's child is full of woe,

Thursday's child has far to go,

Friday's child is loving and giving,

Saturday's child works hard for its living,

But the child that's born on the Sabbath day

Is bonny and blithe, and good and gay.
