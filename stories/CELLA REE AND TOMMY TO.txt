CELLA REE AND TOMMY TO (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  Two funny friends that you all know

  Are Cella Ree and Tommy To.

  About as queer as friends can be,

  Are Tommy To and Cella Ree.

  For hours they sit there grim and stable

  Side by side upon the table.

  Tom is red and Cella pale,

  His blushes are of no avail;

  She sits, in spite of his endeavor,

  As firm and undisturbed as ever,

  A funny pair, you must agree,

  This Tommy To and Cella Ree.
