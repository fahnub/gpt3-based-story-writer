A BEETLE ON A BROOMSTRAW (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  A robin and a wren, as they walked along one night,

  Saw a big brown beetle on a broomstraw.

  Said the robin to the wren: "What a pretty, pretty sight--

  That big brown beetle on a broomstraw!"

  So they got their plates and knives,

  Their children and their wives,

  And gobbled up the beetle on the broomstraw.
