DOUBBLEDOON (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  Bobbin rode a rocking-horse

  'Way down to Doubbledoon,

  He told his little sister

  He'd be back that afternoon.

  But maybe after all she didn't

  Understand him right,

  For he wasn't back again

  Till the middle of the night.



  And what did little Bobbin see

  'Way down at Doubbledoon?

  He saw a crazy Arab

  Throwing bubbles at the moon,

  A monkey making faces

  And a rabbit in a rage,

  A parrot shouting "Murder!"

  From the ceiling of his cage.



  At last a yellow jumping-jack,

  A camel, and a coon,

  Chased poor little Bobbin

  All the way from Doubbledoon.
