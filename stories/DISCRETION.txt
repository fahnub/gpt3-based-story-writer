DISCRETION (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  A man with a nickel,

  A sword, and a sickle,

  A pipe, and a paper of pins

  Set out for the Niger

  To capture a tiger--

  And that's how my story begins.

 When he saw the wide ocean,

  He soon took a notion

  'T would be nicer to stay with his friends.

  So he traded his hat

  For a tortoise-shell cat--

  And that's how the chronicle ends.
