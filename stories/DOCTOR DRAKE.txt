DOCTOR DRAKE (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  On a hummock by the lake

  Stands the home of Doctor Drake,

  Poor old doctor, how he works!

  Week by week he never shirks--



  Pulling teeth for guinea-fowl,

  Soothing puppies when they howl,

  Whittling out a hickory peg

  For a gander's broken leg,



  Giving medicine away

  About a hundred times a day,

  Linseed oil and elder-bark

  To a croaking meadowlark,



  Nasty, bitter yarrow-tea

  To a tipsy bumble-bee,

  A poultice made of plantain leaves

  To cure a rabbit with the heaves.



  Fever, colic, cramp, or stitch,

  Kitten-croup or beaver's-itch,

  Any kind of pain or ache

  Is cured by dear, old Doctor Drake.
