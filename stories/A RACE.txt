A RACE, A RACE TO MOSCOW (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)



  A race, a race to Moscow,

  Before the close of day!

  A race, a race to Moscow,

  A long, long way!

  First comes a butterfly a-riding on a frog,

  Next comes a water rat a-floating on a log;

  A caterpillar on the fence, a hopper in the hay--

  Who'll get to Moscow before the close of day?
