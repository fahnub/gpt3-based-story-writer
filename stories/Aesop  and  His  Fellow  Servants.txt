Aesop  and  His  Fellow  Servants (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)

A  merchant,  who  was  at  one  time  Aesop's  master,  on  a  certain  occasion    ordered  all  things  to  be  made  ready  for  an  intended  journey.    When  the    burdens  were  divided  among  the  Servants,  Aesop  asked  that  he  might  have    the  lightest.    He  was  told  to  choose  for  himself,  and  he  took  up  the    basket  of  bread.    The  other  Servants  laughed,  for  that  was  the  largest    and  heaviest  of  all  the  burdens.

When  dinner-time  came,  Aesop,  who  had  with  some  difficulty  sustained    his  load,  was  told  to  distribute  an  equal  share  all  around.    He  did  so,    and  this  lightened  his  burden  one  half,  and  when  supper-time  arrived  he    got  rid  of  the  rest.

For  the  remainder  of  the  journey  he  had  nothing  but  the  empty  basket  to    carry,  and  the  other  Servants,  whose  loads  seemed  to  get  heavier  and    heavier  at  every  step,  could  not  but  applaud  his  ingenuity.
