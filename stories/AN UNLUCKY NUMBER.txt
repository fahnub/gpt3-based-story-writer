AN UNLUCKY NUMBER (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)

  As soon as old Mr. Crow pushed open the door of Mr. Frog's tailor's shop,  Mr. Frog jumped up quickly. He had been sitting cross-legged upon a  table, sewing. And when he leaped off the table he sprang so high that  his head struck the ceiling.

"What's that noise?" Mr. Crow asked him nervously, when Mr. Frog had  landed upon his feet. "It sounded like thunder; but there's not a cloud  in the sky."

"It was my head," Mr. Frog explained. "It hit the ceiling, you know."

"Oh!" said Mr. Crow. "It made a very hollow sound. But I am not  surprised. I have already learned that your head is quite empty."

"It's certainly not solid," Mr. Frog agreed pleasantly. No matter what  happened, he never lost his temper.

But Mr. Crow was different. _He_ was angry.

"You've got me into a pretty fix!" said he. "And now you must get me out  of it."

"I suppose you want more buttons," Mr. Prog observed. "I noticed as you  came in that you had lost every one."

"No!" Mr. Crow told him. "What I want is to get out of this coat. I've  decided to spend the winter in the South, after all. And here you've been  and gone and sewed the coat on me, and left me no way at all to slip out  of it."

"I beg your pardon," the tailor replied politely. "Pardon _me_--but I  think you are mistaken. I left four openings through which anyone could  crawl out."

Old Mr. Crow looked puzzled.

"I should like to know where they are," he said.

"The neck, the skirts, and the two sleeves!" Mr. Frog told him.

At that Mr. Crow looked at him severely.

"How could you expect me to slip through any of those places?" he asked.

"Why--" said the tailor--"I thought it would be easy for you. I've always  heard you were a very slippery customer."

When he said that, Mr. Crow made some queer noises in his throat, much as  if he were choking.

"Are you ill?" the tailor cried.

"Just a frog in my throat!" Mr. Crow answered.

As he said that. Mr. Frog leaped toward the door. He was a jumpy sort of  person. When anything startled him you could never tell in what direction  he might spring. And he was now about to rush out of his shop when Mr.  Crow caught him and dragged him back.

"You can't go," he shouted, "until you've taken the stitches out of the  back of my coat."

"Oh, certainly!" Mr. Frog quavered. And he set to work at once to open  the back seam of Mr. Crow's coat.

He was a spry worker--was Mr. Frog. In less time than it takes to tell it  he had ripped the back of the coat from collar to hem.

And old Mr. Crow was no less spry in pulling the coat off and flinging it  into a corner.

"There!" Mr. Crow cried. "There's your coat with the thirteen spots on  it! I certainly don't want it, for it has caused me no end of trouble."  Then he turned and hurried out of the shop, without stopping even to  thank Mr. Frog for what he had done.

Before Mr. Crow was out of hearing, the tailor thrust his head through  the doorway and called to the departing Mr. Crow.

"I told you--" said Mr. Frog--"I told you thirteen was an unlucky  number."
