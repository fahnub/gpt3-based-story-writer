night, and for some  time the lovers enjoyed every hour of sunshine together.  One day Prince Rainbow appeared in the depths of woe. He had just heard  that he was to be banished from this lovely spot, but he had no idea  where he was to go. The poor young couple were in despair, and only  parted with the last ray of sunshine, and in hopes of meeting next  morning. Alas! next day was dark and gloomy, and it was only late in the  afternoon that the sun broke through the clouds for a few minutes.
