you  have  sold  nothing  all  day?"  "Why,  Mother,  yonder  is  a  river  that  has  been  running  all  this  day,  and    I  stayed  till  just  now,  waiting  for  it  to  run  out;  and  there  it  is,    running  still."  "My  Son,"  said  the  good  woman,  "thy  head  and  mine  will  be  laid  in  the    grave  many  a  day  before  this  river  has  all  run  by.    You  will  never  sell    your  butter  and  cheese  if  you  wait  for  that."
