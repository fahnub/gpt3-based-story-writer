whitethroat sings,    The quiet fields, the moonlight, and the dew,    The virgin's bower that in wet hedgerow clings.    I have forgotten how the cool grass waves    Where clean winds blow, and where good women pray    For happy, honest men, safe in their graves;    And--oh, my God! I would I were as they!
