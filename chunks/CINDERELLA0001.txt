CINDERELLA (Fable, Ages 0 to 3)    Cinderella's mother died while she was a very little child, leaving her  to the care of her father and her step-sisters, who were very much older  than herself; for Cinderella's father had been twice married, and her  mother was his second wife. Now, Cinderella's sisters did not love her,  and were very unkind to her. As she grew older they made her work as a  servant, and even sift the cinders; on which account they used to call  her in mockery "Cinderella."
