A BEETLE ONCE SAT ON A BARBERRY TWIG (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      A beetle once sat on a barberry twig,    And turned at the crank of a thingum-a-jig.    Needles for hornets, nippers for ants,    For the bumblebee baby a new pair of pants,    For the grizzled old gopher a hat and a wig,    The beetle ground out of his thingum-a-jig.    [Illustration]
