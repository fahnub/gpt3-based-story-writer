CATCALLS (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)    PERCHED on top of Rusty Wren's tin house, Miss Kitty Cat had been  enjoying herself thoroughly, while the birds made a great how-dy-do and  tried in vain to frighten her away.  When she heard all at once an unexpected _meaow_ she showed that it  startled her.  "A cat!" cried Miss Kitty. "I didn't suppose there was another cat for  miles around." She looked about on all sides, on the ground and in the  tree-tops. And there was no cat anywhere in sight.
