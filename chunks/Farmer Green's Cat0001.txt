Farmer Green's Cat (Fable:- Ages 5 to 10)    There were plenty of nuts in the attic of Farmer Green's house, where  Frisky Squirrel found himself a prisoner. And you might think that he  wouldn't have felt so unhappy to be there. But Frisky was unhappy. He  was so frightened that he crept into a corner and stayed there,  shivering, for a long time. And he couldn't have eaten a single one of  those nuts if he had tried. He wanted to be free. He wanted to be out  of doors. He wanted to go home.
