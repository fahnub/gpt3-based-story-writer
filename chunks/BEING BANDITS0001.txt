BEING BANDITS (Fiction:- Ages 5 to 9)  Noel was quite tiresome for ever so long after we found the Princess. He  would keep on wanting to go to the Park when the rest of us didn't, and  though we went several times to please him, we never found that door  open again, and all of us except him knew from the first that it would  be no go.  So now we thought it was time to do something to rouse him from the  stupor of despair, which is always done to heroes when anything baffling  has occurred.
