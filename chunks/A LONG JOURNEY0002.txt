Pleasant Valley--and her home at Farmer Green's.  Having put the first mile of her journey behind her, Miss Kitty stopped  beside a little brook and drank her fill of cool, sweet water. She was  very thirsty, because she hadn't had a drink since the evening before.  A pretty wood stretched beyond the brook, tempting Miss Kitty Cat to  explore it. At that hour of the morning there were many birds twittering  among the trees. And spry chipmunks were frisking about in search of  their breakfast.
