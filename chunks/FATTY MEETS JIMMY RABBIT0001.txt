FATTY MEETS JIMMY RABBIT (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    For once Fatty Coon was not hungry. He had eaten so much of Farmer  Green's corn that he felt as if he could not swallow another mouthful.  He was strolling homewards through the woods when someone called to him.  It was Jimmy Rabbit.  "Where are you going, Fatty?" Jimmy Rabbit asked.  "Home!" said Fatty.  "Are you hungry?" Jimmy Rabbit asked anxiously.  "I should say not!" Fatty answered. "I've just had the finest meal I  ever ate in my life."
