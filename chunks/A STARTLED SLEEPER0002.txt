For a few moments Mr. Crow screamed loudly for help. And he flapped and  floundered about as if he didn't know which way to turn, nor what to do.  During the uproar Dickie Deer Mouse managed to slip out of Mr. Crow's  house without being seen. But he was too polite to run away. Instead of  hurrying off to escape a scolding from Mr. Crow he clung to a near-by  branch and called as loudly as he could:  "Don't be alarmed, sir! There's no one here but me. And I ask your  pardon for disturbing you."
