BIRTHDAY TALK FOR A CHILD (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)      (IRIS.)    DADDY dear, I'm only four    And I'd rather not be more:    Four's the nicest age to be--    Two and two, or one and three.      All I love is two and two,    Mother, Fabian, Paul and you;    All you love is one and three,    Mother, Fabian, Paul and me.      Give your little girl a kiss    Because she learned and told you this.
