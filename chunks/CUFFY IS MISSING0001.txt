CUFFY IS MISSING (Fables:- Ages 0 to 3)    Far up on the dark mountainside, in the driving snow, Nimble waited in  front of the cave where Cuffy Bear had vanished. And all the time Nimble  was growing more uneasy. He feared that Cuffy Bear might be in some sort  of trouble.  Nimble looked all about for help. But there wasn't a sign of anybody  stirring, anywhere. All the mountain people seemed to have sought  shelter from the storm.  At last, however, Peter Mink came sneaking up from the spring.
