After greeting Dorothy  affectionately the huge beasts lay down at the foot of the throne.  While they waited, the Scarecrow, who was near the little boy, asked:  "Why are you called Button-Bright?"  "Don't know," was the answer.  "Oh yes, you do, dear," said Dorothy.  "Tell the Scarecrow how you got  your name."  "Papa always said I was bright as a button, so mama always called me  Button-Bright," announced the boy.  "Where is your mama?" asked the Scarecrow.  "Don't know," said Button-Bright.
