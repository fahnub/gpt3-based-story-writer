"Maybe you'll find out that you're wrong," they told Twinkleheels.  "Maybe you'll learn that Bright and Broad are faster than you think they  are. We've known Farmer Green to take them and leave us here in the  barn--when he was in a hurry to go somewhere, too."  "Ha! ha!" Twinkleheels laughed. "You're joking. You're trying to fool  me."  "Oh, no!" the bays cried. "Ask Bright and Broad themselves."  So Twinkleheels spoke to Bright and Broad the very next day, when he met  them in the barnyard.
