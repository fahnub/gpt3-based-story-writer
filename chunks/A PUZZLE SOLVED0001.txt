A PUZZLE SOLVED (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    "Good morning, Grandfather Mole!" Jolly Robin called.  "What!" cried Grandfather Mole. "Have I made the mistake again of coming  up on top of Farmer Green's garden?"  "You certainly have," Jolly told him.  "I must be getting old," said Grandfather Mole. "I'm growing more  careless every day. I didn't mean to dig my way above ground." And then,  thrusting his long nose right into the dirt, he began to burrow out of  sight.  "Stop! Please stop!" Jolly Robin
