one would believe! This was the Newspaper:        THE LEWISHAM RECORDER    EDITORS:  DORA AND OSWALD BASTABLE         ------------       EDITORIAL NOTE  Every paper is written for some reason. Ours is because we want to sell  it and get money. If what we have written brings happiness to any sad  heart we shall not have laboured in vain. But we want the money too.  Many papers are content with the sad heart and the happiness, but we are  not like that, and it is best not to be deceitful. EDITORS.
