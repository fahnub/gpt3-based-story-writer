the house next door was as dark as dark. Then  suddenly we heard a sound--it came from the gate at the end of the  garden. All the gardens have gates; they lead into a kind of lane that  runs behind them. It is a sort of back way, very convenient when you  don't want to say exactly where you are going. We heard the gate at the  end of the next garden click, and Dicky nudged Alice so that she  would have fallen out of the tree if it had not been for Oswald's  extraordinary presence of mind.
