EAT, EAT, EAT (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Here come the sweet potatoes    And here's the Sunday meat,    I guess we must be ready now    To eat, eat, eat.      I'm going to have the nicey plate    And Daddy's leather seat,    And wear my patent-leather shoes    To eat, eat, eat.      My Daddy's talking all about    The war, and some old fleet,    I wonder if he never, never,    Never wants to eat.      We're going to have some apple-cake,    We're going to have a treat.    O hurry, hurry, Daddy,
