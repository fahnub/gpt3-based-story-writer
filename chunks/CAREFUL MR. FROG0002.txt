"I saw you only a moment ago."  The tailor then peered out of the window at his caller.  "There you are now!" Timothy shouted, as he caught sight of Mr. Frog. "I  say, let me in!"  "I can't," Mr. Frog answered. "I'm sick a-bed."  "Nonsense!" Timothy cried.  "Well, I expect I'll be ill if you don't go away," the tailor answered.
