CAPTAIN TICKLE AND HIS NICKEL (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Captain Tickle had a nickel    In a paper sack,    He threw it in the river    And he couldn't get it back.    Captain Tickle spent his nickel    For a rubber ball,    And when he cut it open    There was nothing there at all.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]
