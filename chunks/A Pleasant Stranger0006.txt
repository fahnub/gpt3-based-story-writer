"Oh, I knew better than to take a swim in the creek that day," Master  Meadow Mouse said. "The Pickerel family were nosing about among the  pickerel weeds around the bend of the creek. I saw them myself. And Mr.  Frog told me I ought to beware of them. He was very anxious--so he  said--about me and the Pickerel. He said he didn't want them to catch  me. He was very kind, I thought."  "Kind!" Mrs. Meadow Mouse spluttered. "He didn't want them to catch you  because he hopes to catch you himself!"
