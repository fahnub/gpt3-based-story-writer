AUNT NANCY'S PLAN(Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)    All was quiet once more, after the race from the ledge near Uncle Jerry  Chuck's home. The flock was feeding again. And if you hadn't noticed how  Aunt Nancy Ewe puffed from her fast running you wouldn't have supposed  there had just been a wild scramble over the stone wall and back.  Aunt Nancy was still feeling sorry for Uncle Jerry Chuck, whose rest had  been disturbed by the thud of hoofs above his head. "Remember!" she said  to Snowball sternly.
