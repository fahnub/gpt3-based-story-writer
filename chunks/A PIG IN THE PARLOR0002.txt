For a few moments Grunty stood sniffing in the doorway. A delicious  odor greeted him. He wasn't sure what it was. A pan sat near the edge  of the table. And Grunty Pig had no trouble upsetting it with his nose.  Doughnuts rolled in every direction--crisp, brown, freshly fried  doughnuts. And Grunty Pig showed that he was thoughtful. He went to the  trouble of picking them all up off the floor. But he forgot to drop them  back into the pan. Instead, he put every one of them into his own mouth.
