A MEALY NOSE (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    It was true, as the bays had said, that Twinkleheels had a mealy nose.  So perhaps it was only natural that they should think he had meal to eat  when they didn't. And he hastened to explain matters to them.  "My mealy nose," he said, "doesn't mean that I've been eating meal. My  nose happens to be the color of meal. All the brushing in the world  wouldn't change it."  The bay pair snorted. It was plain that they didn't believe what  Twinkleheels told them.
