A BUNDLE OF HAY (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      A bundle of hay    From Baffin's Bay,    A johnny-cake from Rome,    A man and a mule    From Ultima Thule    To carry the cargo home.      [Illustration]    [Illustration]    PETER, POPPER    Peter, popper, dopper, Dan,    Catch a moonbeam if you can;    Climb a cedar ten feet high    And pick the planets from the sky.    You're a wonder, little man--    Peter, popper, dopper, Dan.
