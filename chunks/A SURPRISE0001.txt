A SURPRISE (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    One day Cuffy Bear and his little sister Silkie had been making sand  pies. And now, having grown tired of that, they were squatting down on  the ground and had covered their legs with the clean white sand. Perhaps  they would have heaped the sand all over themselves, if Silkie had not  spied her father as he came climbing up the mountain. When they noticed  that he was carrying something they both sprang up and ran to see what  Mr. Bear was bringing home.
