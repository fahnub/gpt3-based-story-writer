ring a bell?" inquired the Cap'n, a  little ashamed of his ignorance and reassured by hearing the "ghost"  talk.  "It surely did," was the reply, "and Sacho told me to answer your  bell and look after you. So I'm a-lookin' after you."  "I wish you wouldn't," protested Cap'n Bill. "I've no use fer--fer  ghostses, anyhow."  The strange sailor began to chuckle at hearing this, and his chuckle  was just like Cap'n Bill's chuckle, so full of merry humor that it  usually made everyone laugh with him.
