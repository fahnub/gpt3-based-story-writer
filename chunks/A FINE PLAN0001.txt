A FINE PLAN (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    Chirpy Cricket was one of Freddie Firefly's neighbors. He was a good  neighbor for anybody to have, too, because he was one of the most  cheerful of all the field and forest-folk that lived in Pleasant Valley.  Freddie Firefly liked him. And he often remarked that he would rather  hear Chirpy Cricket sing than sing himself.  Since he was so fond of hearing Chirpy's songs, it was lucky for Freddie  that his sprightly neighbor usually chose to sing at night,
