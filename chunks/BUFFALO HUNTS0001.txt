BUFFALO HUNTS (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)    Johnnie Green found, after a while, that owning a cow wasn't all fun.  There were times when he would have been willing to let his father, or  the hired man, milk the Muley Cow. For instance, a boy from a  neighboring farm might come along about milking-time with a fine plan  for play. Or someone driving past the house on his way to the village  might ask Johnnie to go along too.  Once or twice, on such occasions, Johnnie tried to wriggle out of  milking.
