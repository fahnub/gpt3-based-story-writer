BILLY BUMPKINS (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Heigho, Billy Bumpkins,    How d' you grow your pumpkins?    "At six o'clock I sows 'em,    At ten o'clock I hoes 'em,    An' jes before I goes to bed    I puts 'em in the pumpkin shed."      Tell us, Billy Bumpkins,    How d' you sell your pumpkins?    "I lends 'em to the ladies,    I gives 'em to the babies,    An' trades a hundred for a kiss    To any pretty little miss."      [Illustration]
