Around the farmhouse she was politeness itself--when there was anybody  to observe her. If her meals were late she never clamored, as Johnnie  Green sometimes did. To be sure, she might remind Mrs. Green gently, by  plaintive mewing, that she had not had her saucer of milk. But she was  always careful not to be rude about it. And though Miss Kitty liked a  warm place in winter, she never crowded anybody else away from the fire.  She crept under the kitchen range, where no one else cared to sit.
