ANTLERS (Fables:- Ages 0 to 3)    Although Nimble had lost his horns he managed to go through the winter  without missing them as much as he had expected. And in time he had  almost forgotten the pair of spikes that he had worn on his head the  summer before. Then, one day, he made a great discovery.
