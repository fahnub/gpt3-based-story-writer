A HARD SHELL (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    RUSTY WREN hurried home, carrying Mrs. Ladybug despite her frantic  efforts to escape. She wriggled all her six legs at the same time.  "She'll be pleased with this one," Rusty murmured, as he watched Mrs.  Ladybug's struggles. "Mrs. Wren will certainly thank me when I give her  this morsel."  And she did.  "How lovely!" Mrs. Wren exclaimed when Rusty gave her his captive.  And he was so glad that he hastened away to try to find another just  like that one.
