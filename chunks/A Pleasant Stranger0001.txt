A Pleasant Stranger (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    THE whole Meadow Mouse family enjoyed swimming. They liked to live near  water. That was why they made their home in the low meadow, where Broad  Brook ran deeper and more quietly than in the hillside pasture. And  Black Creek, too, was near-by. So the Meadow Mouse family never had to  travel far when they wanted a cool dip.  Almost as soon as he was able to wander about the meadow alone Master  Meadow Mouse began to swim. He didn't have to be taught,
