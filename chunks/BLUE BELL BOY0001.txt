BLUE BELL BOY (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)  I had a little boy,    And called him Blue Bell;  Gave him a little work,--    He did it very well.    I bade him go upstairs    To bring me a gold pin;  In coal scuttle fell he,    Up to his little chin.    He went to the garden    To pick a little sage;  He tumbled on his nose,    And fell into a rage.    He went to the cellar    To draw a little beer;  And quickly did return    To say there was none there.
