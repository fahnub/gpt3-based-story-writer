further side of it was a thick plantation of  slender silver birches and whispering poplars; and beyond it was Uncle  Roger's house.  Right before us, girt about with its trim spruce hedge, was the  famous King orchard, the history of which was woven into our earliest  recollections. We knew all about it, from father's descriptions, and in  fancy we had roamed in it many a time and oft.  It was now nearly sixty years since it had had its beginning, when  Grandfather King brought his bride home.
