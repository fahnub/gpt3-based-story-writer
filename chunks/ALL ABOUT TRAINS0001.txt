ALL ABOUT TRAINS (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    "What do you mean?" Freddie Firefly asked little Mrs. Ladybug. "What  accident could happen if the wind blew out my light?" And he laughed  very hard, because he knew that no gale was strong enough even to dim  his greenish-white gleams.  "Why," replied Mrs. Ladybug, "the train would strike you and be wrecked.  You see," she continued, "I have everything planned for you. You're  going to spend your nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the  trains."
