villagers, such as Grandaddy Beaver, began  to see that something would have to be done. There was the dam, which  needed mending; and there was the winter's food, which had to be  gathered.  So Grandaddy Beaver went to Ferdinand Frog one day and told him that he  simply _must_ come to the rescue of the pond folk, and tell them how  they might have clothes as far ahead of the times as were his own.  "Why?" Mr. Frog inquired. "What's the trouble?"  "They can't work," Grandaddy Beaver told him.
