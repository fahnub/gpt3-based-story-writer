theSheriff and their men in the forest, and a bloody fight followed.Thefirst man slain in that fight was the Sheriff of Nottingham, for he fellfrom his horse with an arrow in his brain ere half a score of shafts hadbeen sped. Many a better man than the Sheriff kissed the sod that day,but at last, Sir William Dale being wounded and most of his men slain,he withdrew, beaten, and left the forest.But scores of good fellowswere left behind him, stretched out all stiff beneath the sweet greenboughs.
