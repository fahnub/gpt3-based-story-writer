throat  to  cut,    And  put  him  in  the  pot.      The  bird's  complaint  resounded    In  glorious  melody;      Whereat  the  Cook,  astounded    His  sad  mistake  to  see,  Cried,  "What!  make  soup  of  a  musician!  Please  God,  I'll  never  set  such  dish  on.  No,  no;  I'll  never  cut  a  throat  That  sings  so  passing  sweet  a  note."      _'Tis  thus,  whatever  peril  may  alarm  us,  Sweet  words  will  surely  never  harm  us_.
