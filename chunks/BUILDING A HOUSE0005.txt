"below frost-line."  You must not think it was an easy matter for Sandy Chipmunk to dig a  home. You must remember that somehow he had to bring the dirt out of his  tunnel to the top of the ground. And he did that by _pushing it ahead of  him with his nose_.  You may laugh when you hear that. But for Sandy Chipmunk it was no  laughing matter. If _he_ had laughed, just as likely as not he would have  found his mouth full of dirt. And you can understand that that wouldn't  have been very pleasant.
