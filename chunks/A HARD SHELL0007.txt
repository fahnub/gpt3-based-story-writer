--about little  Mrs. Ladybug. For Mrs. Ladybug had had a dreadful fright. Luckily she  wasn't hurt. But it was a long time before she was her usual busy, able  self again. And later, when she told her friends about her adventure,  she said that she couldn't understand how Rusty came to make such a  mistake.  "I supposed," Mrs. Ladybug declared, "that every bird in Pleasant Valley  knew I wasn't good to eat."
