DICKY.         ------------  SAM REDFERN, OR THE BUSH RANGER'S BURIAL         By Dicky  'Well, Annie, I have bad news for you,' said Mr Ridgway, as he entered  the comfortable dining-room of his cabin in the Bush. 'Sam Redfern the  Bushranger is about this part of the Bush just now. I hope he will not  attack us with his gang.'  'I hope not,' responded Annie, a gentle maiden of some sixteen summers.  Just then came a knock at the door of the hut, and a gruff voice asked  them to open the door.
