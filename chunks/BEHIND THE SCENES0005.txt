thestroak of nine? "declare for good and good will work for you" is one ofour sayings. I have not time to treet Lafayette myself my busness beingso engroassing but if you would take a few minites each night and _denyFear along the 5 avanues_ you could heel him.

POWERS,  _Mental Heeler_.  Oh, what a naughty,
