BLUE FLAMES AND RED FLAMES (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Blue flames and red flames    In a world all dark;    Blue flames and red flames,    And a tiny spark    Hurrying to heaven, lest it should be late;    Lest the cautious seraphim close the shining gate,    And leave the little wanderer forevermore to fly    Like an orphan angel through the endless sky.
