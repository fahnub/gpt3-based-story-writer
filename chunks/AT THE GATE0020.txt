there the Heavenly vision comes no more,    Only, each Easter now, a lily sweet    Lies white and dewy on the chancel floor    Where once had stood the beloved wounded feet;    And the old Abbot feels the nearing beat    Of wings that bring him leave at last to go    And meet his Master, where the immortal lilies grow.
