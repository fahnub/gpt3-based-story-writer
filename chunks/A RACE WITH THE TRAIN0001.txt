A RACE WITH THE TRAIN (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    Old Mr. Crow was fond of gay clothes. Perhaps it was because he was so  black that he always chose bright colors. Anyhow, so long as he could  wear a bright red coat and a yellow necktie--or a bright red necktie and  a yellow coat--he was generally quite happy.  All his neighbors knew who he was as far as they could see him. No matter  if they caught only a flash of yellow or of red, they were pretty safe in  saying, "There goes old Mr. Crow!"
