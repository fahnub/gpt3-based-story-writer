Elephant  and  Frog  (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)    I  often  tell  of  Mr.  Elephant  and  Mr.  Frog,  who  were  courting  at  one    house.  One  day  Mr.  Frog  spake  to  the  sweetheart  of  Mr.  Elephant,  saying:  "Mr.    Elephant  is  my  horse."    Mr.  Elephant,  when  he  came  at  night,  then  the    girls  tell  him,  saying:  "Thou  art  the  horse  of  Mr.  Frog!"  Mr.  Elephant  then  goes  to  Mr.  Frog's,  saying:  "Didst  thou  tell  my    sweetheart  that  I  am  thy  horse?"
