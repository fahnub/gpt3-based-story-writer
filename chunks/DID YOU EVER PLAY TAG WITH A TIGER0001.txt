DID YOU EVER PLAY TAG WITH A TIGER? (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Did you ever play tag with a tiger,    Or ever play boo with a bear;    Did you ever put rats in the rain-barrel    To give poor old Granny a scare?    It's fun to play tag with a tiger,    It's fun for the bear to say "boo,"    But if rats are found in the rain-barrel    Old Granny will put you in too.    [Illustration]
