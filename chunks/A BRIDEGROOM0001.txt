A BRIDEGROOM (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    DADDY LONGLEGS was taken entirely by surprise. It was rather early in  the morning. And he had not expected callers--at least not so many as  suddenly appeared at the stone wall where he was usually to be found.  Luckily he was arrayed in his very best clothes. Indeed, he was quite  smartly dressed--for him. A bright yellow scarf, tied in a big bow  beneath his chin, made him look almost dandified. And he was wearing a  bottle-green coat, lined with pink.
