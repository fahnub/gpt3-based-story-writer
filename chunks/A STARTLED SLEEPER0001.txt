A STARTLED SLEEPER (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    Of course Dickie Deer Mouse ought not to have been so ready to believe  that stray bit of gossip about Mr. Crow. It is true that the old black  scamp had _talked_ about moving to a new place nearer Farmer Green's  cornfield. But his plan had gone no further than that.  He was sound asleep in his bed when Dickie Deer Mouse jumped down beside  him. And when Mr. Crow suddenly waked up it would be very hard to say  which of the two was the more startled.
