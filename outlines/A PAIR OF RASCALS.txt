Mr. Frog is a tailor who lives by a creek. One day, he sees Mr. Crow flying overhead and calls out to him. Mr. Crow is on his way to the cornfield and doesn't want to stop, but Mr. Frog insists that he has important news.

Mr. Frog tells Mr. Crow that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler and that's how he makes his famous "Katy did, Katy" song. Mr. Crow is unimpressed and tells Mr. Frog that he won't be spreading this news around.

Mr. Frog is disappointed but Mr. Crow is unmoved. He tells Mr. Frog that he's not going to tell Brownie Beaver about the news either, because they've had a disagreement. Mr. Crow flies off to the cornfield and Mr. Frog is left alone.
