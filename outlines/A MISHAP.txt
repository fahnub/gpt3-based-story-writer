Johnnie Green is a young boy who loves to collect butterflies. However, he can only hunt for them when the weather is good. When a three-day rain comes, Johnnie becomes bored and wishes he had started a different kind of collection.

The weather clears at last and Johnnie hurriedly takes his dog, Spot, and his butterfly net to the flower garden. He soon spots a beautiful butterfly, Betsy, and starts to chase her. Betsy is not afraid of Johnnie and even allows him to get close to her.

 Johnnie Green tries to capture Betsy in his net, but he trips and falls. This gives Betsy the chance to escape. Johnnie's dog, Spot, also tries to run away from the scene and ends up getting his head stuck in the butterfly net. Spot runs all the way to the woods before he is able to free himself.

Johnnie is sad that he lost Betsy and has to start his collection all over again.
