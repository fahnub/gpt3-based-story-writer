Turkey Proudfoot is a vain and foolish gobbler who is also the ruler of Farmer Green's flock of turkeys. He is spoiled by the hen turkeys, who always do as he says, and he often picks fights with the younger gobblers. He also has a habit of attacking anyone he sees, including Farmer Green.

One day, Farmer Green gets tired of Turkey Proudfoot's antics and decides to teach him a lesson. He hits him on the head with a stick, and Turkey Proudfoot never bothers him again. This shows that Turkey Proudfoot is not as empty-headed as some people think, and that he is capable of learning from his mistakes.
