In the story, "A New Name for Daddy", the protagonist, Daddy Longlegs, is a spider who has lost one of his legs. His neighbor, little Mr. Chippy, comes up with the idea that since Daddy Longlegs is so changed, they should call him by a different name. Mr. Chippy suggests the name "Grandfather Graybeard", but Buster Bumblebee doesn't think much of that name because Daddy Longlegs has no beard. Ultimately, the other animals decide to call Daddy Longlegs by his new name and they all go to tell him the news.
