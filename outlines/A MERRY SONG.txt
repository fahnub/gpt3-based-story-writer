The Frog family is singing a merry song when Timothy Turtle interrupts them, complaining that they are making too much noise. Ferdinand Frog tells Timothy that they will sing a special song for him, and the whole family starts bellowing their loudest. The song is about a grumpy turtle who is mean and cruel, and Timothy doesn't like it. He tries to drown out the noise by hiding in the mud at the bottom of Black Creek, but he can still hear the song echoing across Pleasant Valley.
