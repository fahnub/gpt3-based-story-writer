Farmer Green has fenced off a piece of the old orchard and turned Mrs. Pig's children into the new yard. The children have a great time there, rooting around, playing, and sometimes an apple will drop from the tree and they have a mad scramble for it.

Jolly Robin and his wife are sitting in their nest in an apple tree and Jolly Robin's wife comments on how loud Mrs. Pig's children are. Jolly Robin says they're just having a good time and we shouldn't complain. Suddenly, they hear Grunty Pig right beneath them and he asks if they're talking about him. They try to deny it but he doesn't believe them and accuses them of making fun of his whole family. He says he'll have to teach them a lesson.

Jolly Robin and his wife laugh at the idea of Grunty Pig teaching them a lesson in manners and he flies away.
