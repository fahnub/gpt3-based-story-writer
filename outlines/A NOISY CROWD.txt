A crowd of animals has gathered at Farmer Green's house to watch the races and other sports that have been organized by Benjamin Bat. Among the crowd is Mr. Frog, who is trying to be the center of attention and is objecting to every arrangement that Benjamin has made.

Kiddie Katydid is hiding among the leaves, listening to the conversations and occasionally talking to the other animals. When Mr. Frog suggests a swimming contest, Kiddie objects, saying that he would drown himself. Everybody laughs at Mr. Frog, who then goes to hide in the watering trough.

Benjamin Bat is having trouble finding anyone who is willing to participate in the contest of hanging upside down by their heels. When he asks Kiddie Katydid, Kiddie declines. Benjamin becomes angry and threatens to eat Kiddie if he doesn't participate. Kiddie remains silent and hopes that Benjamin will go away and get a good meal before coming back.
