Cinderella is a young girl who is treated poorly by her stepmother and stepsisters. Despite her difficult circumstances, Cinderella remains a kind and good-natured person. When the King's son holds a ball, Cinderella's stepsisters are invited and Cinderella is left at home.

Cinderella's kind godmother, who is a fairy, comes to visit her and grants her wish to go to the ball. Cinderella's godmother transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, six mice into six beautiful horses, and a rat into a handsome coachman. She also transforms Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown and glass slippers.

At the ball, Cinderella dances with the Prince and captivates the entire room with her beauty and grace. As midnight approaches, Cinderella remembers her godmother's warning and flees the ball, leaving behind one of her glass slippers.

The Prince finds the glass slipper and sets out to find the woman it belongs to. After trying it on dozens of women with no success, the Prince finally comes to Cinderella's house. When Cinderella tries on the glass slipper, it fits perfectly. She is revealed to be the beautiful woman the Prince has been looking for and they live happily ever after.
