Down the hill from Farmer Green's house, a great beech tree stands beside the road. In the fall, when the nuts are ripe, Johnnie Green, Frisky Squirrel, and Jasper Jay all visit the tree to eat the beechnuts. They all think of the tree as theirs, and nobody else's.

One day in the fall, Grunty Pig wanders down the road and smells the beechnuts. He begins to search for them among the fallen leaves and finds a cluster of them inside a bur that the frost has split open. He eats the sweet nuts, shells and all.

Frisky Squirrel sees him and scolds him, telling him that the beechnuts belong to him, Johnnie Green, and Jasper Jay. Grunty Pig doesn't care and continues to search for more beechnuts.

Jasper Jay arrives and also scolds Grunty Pig. Grunty Pig doesn't listen and continues to search for more beechnuts.
