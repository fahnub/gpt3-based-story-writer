In the story, "A Warning," Timothy Turtle is visiting the beaver pond and is being rude to everyone he meets. He complains about the pond and the frogs, and says that he doesn't understand why anyone would want to live there. He also says that he won't be back for forty years.

 Brownie Beaver's mother is the fat lady that Timothy Turtle grabs by the tail. After she is insulted by Timothy, Brownie Beaver decides that he will make Timothy Turtle work.

The Beavers are always working on their dam, and Timothy Turtle often watches them. One day, a Beaver asks Timothy if he wants to help them, and Timothy gets angry. He says that he never has worked and never intends to.

 Brownie Beaver decides to put Timothy to work anyway. He makes Timothy climb a steep bluff, and Timothy falls and hurts himself. Timothy learns his lesson and decides that maybe he should try working after all.
