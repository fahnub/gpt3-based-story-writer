Old Mr. Crow is always careful to bring his umbrella with him whenever he leaves the house, ever since the time he got caught in the rain and got soaked. One day, while he's sitting on Farmer Green's fence in the rain, Jasper Jay and Frisky Squirrel both come and ask to share his umbrella. Then Fatty Coon comes and squeezes under the umbrella too, nearly pushing Mr. Crow off the fence. The weight of the umbrella and the three animals starts to tilt it, and Mr. Crow gets soaked. Suddenly, they all fall off the fence, and Mr. Crow is even more soaked. Christopher Crane comes and laughs at them, telling them he thought the umbrella was a toadstool. Mr. Crow goes home, coughing and sneezing, and decides he's done with sharing his umbrella.
