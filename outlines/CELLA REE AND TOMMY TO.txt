Cella Ree and Tommy To are two friends that everyone knows. They are as queer as friends can be, and they sit side by side on a table for hours. Tom is red and Cella is pale, but her complexion is not affected by his blushing. She remains as firm and undisturbed as ever. These two make a funny pair.
