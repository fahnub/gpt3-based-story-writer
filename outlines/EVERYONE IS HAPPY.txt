The story is about a frog who is a tailor and the beaver family who are his customers. The frog is trying to collect payment from the beavers for their new clothes, but the beavers refuse to pay, saying that it's not fashionable to do so. The frog then tricks the beavers into paying him by pretending that he will make their clothes for free if they promise to wear them. The beavers agree and the frog gets his payment. In the end, the frog laughs at the beavers for their new clothes and for falling for his trick.
