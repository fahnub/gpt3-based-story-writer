Jasper Jay ignores Mr. Crow's warning and imitates Mr. Red-shouldered Hawk's cry, much to the latter's anger. Jasper hides in an oak tree in the farmyard, waiting to scare the hens with the hawk's cry. His plans are thwarted when Noisy Jake screams first, sending the hens and their chicks running for cover. Jasper gets revenge on Noisy Jake by sending him to a different tree, but is caught by the hawk himself.
