The Man in the Moon looks out from his perch and sees that it is time for all the children on Earth to go to bed. He sends a message down to them, telling them to get ready for bed. The children all begin to get ready, brushing their teeth and putting on their pajamas. They crawl into bed and say their prayers, then settle down to sleep. The Man in the Moon watches over them as they sleep, and when morning comes, he bids them all goodnight.
