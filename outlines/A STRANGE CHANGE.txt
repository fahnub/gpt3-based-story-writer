Freddie Firefly and Dusty Moth are discussing the latter's recent loss of appetite, brought on by his infatuation with the former's picture of the beautiful Betsy Butterfly. To Dusty's dismay, the picture is of an ugly caterpillar, not the beautiful butterfly he was expecting.

Jimmy Rabbit, the artist who made the picture, tries to explain that it is an accurate portrayal of Betsy Butterfly at an earlier stage in her life, but Dusty is not convinced. He flies off in disgust, vowing never to think of Betsy again.
