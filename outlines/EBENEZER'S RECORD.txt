Two horses, Ebenezer and Twinkleheels, race to the bars. Johnnie Green gives them oats and leads them down the lane. Twinkleheels compliments Ebenezer on his speed and the two agree to race again. The Muley Cow interrupts to tell them that Ebenezer used to be the fastest horse around and had a record. Twinkleheels is amazed and Ebenezer explains that a horse's record is the fastest time he's ever made in a race.

The Muley Cow goes into the barn grumbling about Twinkleheels. Ebenezer and Twinkleheels continue to race and though Twinkleheels never wins, he enjoys the sport.
