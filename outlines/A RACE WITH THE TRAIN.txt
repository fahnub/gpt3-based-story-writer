Mr. Crow is a black bird who likes to wear bright colors. He often flies down to the village to watch the trains puff along the railroad. He sometimes races with the trains and always beats them. One day, he races with a train and as soon as he passes the engine, he swoopes down and flies right across the track in front of it. The train makes a noise and comes to a sudden stop. Two men jump down from the engine and walk along the track. They get back in the engine and the train goes slowly on again. Mr. Crow thinks the train is angry because he beat it and decides to race it again tomorrow.
