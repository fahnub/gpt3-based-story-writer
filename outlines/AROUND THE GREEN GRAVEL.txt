The story is about a group of pretty maids who are all dressed in green. They are playing around in a green gravel pit when they are suddenly confronted by a group of ugly maids who are all dressed in black. The ugly maids start to wash the pretty maids with milk and then clothe them in silk. They write the names of the pretty maids on their clothes with a pen and ink. The pretty maids are then able to go back to their green gravel pit and continue playing.
