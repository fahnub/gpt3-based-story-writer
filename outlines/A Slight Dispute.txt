Jimmy Rabbit is a tooth puller who lives in a hollow stump. Uncle Jerry Chuck comes to him to have a tooth pulled, but doesn't want to pay. Jimmy tells him it will be an ear of corn for the tooth, and Uncle Jerry agrees. Jimmy pulls the tooth and Uncle Jerry demands his ear of corn. When Jimmy tells him he just wants his tooth back, Uncle Jerry is so confused he goes home without another word.
