Sandy Chipmunk is taught by his mother to beware of Grumpy Weasel, a slim, brown creature with a white underside. Sandy catches glimpses of Grumpy twice during his first summer, but is never harmed. The following winter, Sandy sees a slim, white creature headed for the stone wall near his home and assumes it is a stranger. He calls out to the creature, but it does not answer. When it turns around, Sandy realizes it is Grumpy Weasel and runs away. Sandy escapes and Grumpy is unable to find the door to the Chipmunk's burrow. Mrs. Chipmunk blames herself for Sandy's adventure and remembers to tell her son that every fall, Grumpy Weasel changes his summer dress for a winter one.
