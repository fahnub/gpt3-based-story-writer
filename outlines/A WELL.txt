A well is a deep, round hole in the ground that is used to store water. It is lined with stones or bricks to prevent the water from seeping out. The bottom of the well is usually much deeper than the top, so that the water can be drawn up using a bucket or a rope and pulley system.

All the king's horses can't fill up a well, because it is so deep. Even if they tried, the water would just seep out through the stones or bricks lining the well.
