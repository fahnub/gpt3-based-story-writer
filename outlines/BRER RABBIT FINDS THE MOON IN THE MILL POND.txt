In May, Brer Rabbit is feeling fine and sets off down the road without knowing where he's going. He meets Brer Tarrypin, who asks him where he's headed. Brer Rabbit tells him he's going to have some fun and show everyone a new trick.

Brer Rabbit then heads to Miss Motts and Miss Meadows' houses to tell them about the mill pond fishin' party he's throwing. Everyone agrees to come and they all meet at the pond.

Brer Rabbit jumps in, pretending to be looking for fish, but instead he finds the moon! He calls everyone over to take a look. They all agree that they need to get the moon out of the pond or else it will be goodbye to the light at night.

They all grab onto the seine and start to haul it in, but they have trouble because they're all either too tall or too short. Brer Rabbit just laughs and enjoys the show.

In the end, they all get wet and the moon is safe.
