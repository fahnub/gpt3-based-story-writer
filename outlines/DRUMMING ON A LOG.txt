Turkey Proudfoot is a barnyard fowl who likes to range over the fields in search of food. One day, he strays into the woods and comes across a beech tree. He starts to eat the nuts on the ground when he hears a loud thumping sound. He realizes that it is coming from a short-necked, feathered gentleman sitting on a log and decides to investigate.

The gentleman is Mr. Grouse, who is drumming on the log in anticipation of a friend. When he sees Turkey Proudfoot, he is disappointed and tells him to go home. Turkey Proudfoot is indignant and orders Mr. Grouse to call his friend so that he can show her a tail that is a tail. Mr. Grouse is unimpressed and tells Turkey Proudfoot that he is just a barnyard fowl who knows nothing about game birds.
