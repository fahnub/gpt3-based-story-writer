Mr. Frog brings a present for Kiddie Katydid - an overcoat - all the way from the creek. Kiddie is pleased, but a little bit anxious, as he only wears green. Mr. Frog assures him that the overcoat is green and hangs it on a twig for Kiddie to try on later. He then goes back to the watering trough to wet his feet. When he comes back, Kiddie has already tried on the overcoat and loves it.
