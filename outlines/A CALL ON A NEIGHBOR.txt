Daddy Longlegs is delighted to be home again and his neighbors remark that they have never seen him so happy and cheerful. One reason for Daddy's good spirits is the fact that the wind no longer blows and he can venture abroad without being buffeted about.

 Daddy Longlegs is so relieved by the change in the weather that it seems to him there could be no danger anywhere and he begins to feel quite important. His friends rush to the stone wall to talk with him and he begins to boast about his wild ride in Farmer Green's wagon.

At first, Daddy's friends enjoy hearing about his adventure, but he boasts so much about his bravery that his listeners soon grow tired of hearing him talk. And instead of his having many callers, it is not long before Daddy Longlegs finds that nobody comes near him, even to say howdy-do.

Feeling that he is in danger of choking over the babble that surges up from within him, Daddy Longlegs decides to go and call on Rusty Wren, who lives in the cherry tree near Farmer Green's bedroom window.

Rusty is perched on the tin roof of his house when Daddy Longlegs arrives and the first thing that Daddy Longlegs says to him is this: "Is your wife at home?" Rusty says "No!" in such a cheerful tone that Daddy Longlegs knows they can have a good chat without being disturbed.
