Fatty Coon is playing with Jimmy Rabbit and his brother when they get into an argument and Jimmy cuts off Fatty's mustache. Fatty has been looking for them for weeks to get revenge. He finally finds them, but they tell him they have the pink-eye and he should stay away. Fatty doesn't believe them and gets angry, but then he notices their eyes are actually pink. Jimmy tells him they're playing robbers and Fatty should be the robber. Fatty agrees and hides behind a tree. The Rabbit brothers never come back, and Fatty realizes he's been tricked. He becomes a laughing-stock among the forest-people, who constantly call him "Robber!" because of his black mask-like fur.
