Kiddie Katydid and Leaper the Locust quarreled over a message that was meant for Mr. Grasshopper. They drew a crowd around them and a stranger who looked like he had travelled a long distance and had a mail-pouch slung over his back asked about the dispute. Kiddie and Leaper explained the quarrel to him and the stranger said that he had the message in his mail-bag but he didn't know which one it was meant for. Leaper the Locust gave a great shout and said that the message was meant for Kiddie Katydid. The stranger gave the message to Kiddie and Leaper the Locust was too late.
