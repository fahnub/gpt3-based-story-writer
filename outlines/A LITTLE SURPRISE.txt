The Muley Cow has learned to not be disturbed by Johnnie Green's clothesline lasso and the rope does her no harm. Johnnie begins to tire of the sport of buffalo hunting with the Muley Cow and wishes he could try lassoing her from the back of the old horse Ebenezer. The Muley Cow, old dog Spot, and Johnnie Green are in the back pasture one day and Johnnie pauses to pick a few blackberries. Old dog Spot begins to growl and Johnnie Green is sure that they have stumbled on game of some sort. The Muley Cow thinks it is a woodchuck and intends to tell the whole herd how old dog Spot did not dare chase the woodchuck. Johnnie Green picks up a stone and throws it into the clump of bushes and hears something that is between a growl and a grunt. The Muley Cow knows that no woodchuck ever made a sound like that and she realizes it is a bear. The Muley Cow flees and Johnnie Green is running towards the hidden game when the bear appears in front of him.
