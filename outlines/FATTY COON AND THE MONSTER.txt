One night, Fatty Coon is strolling along the road when he is almost caught by a monster. The monster is fast and Fatty is only able to escape by jumping to the side of the road. The monster then runs away up the hill.

Fatty Coon hurries home to tell his mother about his escape. His mother is excited and they both climb to the top of a poplar tree to see the monster. The monster is at Farmer Green's house and after a short conversation with Farmer Green, the monster drives away.

Fatty and his mother watch the monster as it drives down the valley and then they know it is gone. Fatty asks his mother if the monster ate Farmer Green and his family and she says she hopes so.
