Cuffy Bear is floating down the river on a cake of ice. He is huddled up in a little black heap in the center of the cake, and crying as if his heart would break. Cuffy is worried that he will never see his mother and father and Silkie again. If only he knew how to swim, like his father! But he doesn't; and there he is, being swept away down the valley, right toward Farmer Green's house.

When Cuffy thinks about Farmer Green he is more frightened than ever and he begins to scream. He remembers all the dreadful things he has heard about men and the things they do to little bears.

Pretty soon Cuffy sees something move up on the bank ahead of him. And he stops screaming. He is afraid that it is Farmer Green himself and he thought he had better keep still. Then perhaps Farmer Green wouldn't see him. But to his dismay the big black thing begins to slide down the steep bank right toward the river.

Cuffy's heart seems to stand still. He shut his eyes tight and tried to make himself as small as he could. And he hardly breathed.

Then somebody called his name. Cuffy was so surprised that he looked up, and there was his father standing on the edge of the stream. Cuffy was _so_ glad to see him!

Mr. Bear seemed very cross, but Cuffy did not mind that, he was _so_ glad to see his father.

"Oh, Father! What shall I do?" Cuffy cried.

Mr. Bear said just one word. It was _"Jump!"_

Cuffy could hardly believe his ears.

_"Jump!"_ said Mr. Bear again.

"I don't know how to swim," Cuffy whined.

_"Jump, jump, jump!"_ Mr. Bear repeated very sternly.

Still Cuffy did not jump. He was so afraid of that rushing water!

Then Mr. Bear became very, very angry. He gave a great roar and plunged into the icy water. With a few strong strokes--for Mr. Bear was a fine swimmer--he reached the middle of the river. And as he swam close up to Cuffy he reached out and gave that naughty, frightened little bear a shove that sent him flying into the stream.
