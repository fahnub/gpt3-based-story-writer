It's a week of birthdays in this rhyming story, with each day representing a different age. On Monday, a newborn is described as fair of face. Tuesday's child is full of grace, while Wednesday's child is full of woe. Thursday's child has far to go, while Friday's child is loving and giving. Saturday's child works hard for its living, but the child born on the Sabbath is bonny and blithe, and good and gay.
