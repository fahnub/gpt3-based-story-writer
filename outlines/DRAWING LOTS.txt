Buster Bumblebee's mother tells her forty-nine honey-makers that Freddie Firefly and at least forty-eight of his relations are expected at the Bumblebees' house at dusk. Each Firefly will provide a light for the honey-makers to use while they work in the clover field at night. The honey-makers are angry about having to work half the night, and one of them tries to escape when they are told they will have to draw lots to see who goes with Freddie. The one who tries to escape is the one who is chosen, and she is the worst-tempered of the bunch. Freddie begins to wish he had gone to the dance at the swamp.
