In winter, an icicle hangs from a roof, sparkling in the cold sun. It's a beautiful sight, but it's also a dangerous one. If the icicle falls, it could seriously injure someone.

As the days grow warmer, the icicle begins to melt. The water drips down, slowly at first, but then faster and faster. Finally, the icicle falls to the ground, where it shatters into pieces.

The icicle is just a temporary fixture of winter. It will be back next year, but in the meantime, it's a reminder of the changing seasons and the cycles of life.
