Diddle diddle dumpling, my son John
Went to bed with his breeches on,
One stocking off, and one stocking on;
Diddle diddle dumpling, my son John.

John's mother is not happy with him going to bed with his breeches on and one stocking off. She tucks him in and tells him to go to sleep. John's father comes in and asks what's wrong. John's mother tells him that their son went to bed with his breeches on and one stocking off. John's father says that he used to do the same thing when he was a boy. John's mother tells him that he should go talk to their son and tell him to take his breeches off. John's father goes into John's room and tells him to take his breeches off. John does as he is told and goes to sleep.
