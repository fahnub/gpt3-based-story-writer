Mrs. Ladybug finds Jennie that evening and tries to talk to her about stopping her leaf-eating ways. Jennie interrupts her and starts playing around, knocking Mrs. Ladybug down. Mrs. Ladybug gets angry and tries to speak to Jennie again, but Jennie just keeps playing and knocking her down.

Finally, Mrs. Ladybug gets so angry that she starts to chase Jennie around. Jennie leads her on a merry chase until they come to a pond. Jennie then dives into the pond and Mrs. Ladybug can't follow her. Jennie resurfaces and laughs at Mrs. Ladybug, who is angry and frustrated.
