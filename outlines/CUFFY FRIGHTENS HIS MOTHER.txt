Cuffy Bear has a run-in with some bees and comes home with his face swollen and in pain. His family doesn't recognize him and his father tells him to leave. Cuffy starts to cry and says it's only him, at which point his family realizes who he is. His mother helps him to bed and he falls asleep. A few days later, he and his father go back to the bee tree to get some honey. They discover that it's not a bee tree at all, but a hornet's nest. Cuffy's father is disappointed, but Cuffy is just glad that he won't have to go near the bees again.
