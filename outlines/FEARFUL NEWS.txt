Grunty Pig and his family are let out of their pen to enjoy a picnic in a little yard on the farm. Grunty, not content to stay with the rest of the family, finds a hole in the fence and squeezes through to explore. He soon finds himself face-to-face with the Muley Cow, who warns him of the bears that live on Blue Mountain and sometimes come down the lane. Grunty Pig is unafraid and declares that he would like to meet a bear. He zigzags up the hill through the pasture, stopping to dig up roots along the way. When he finally returns home, he excitedly tells his mother that he saw a bear in the pasture. Mrs. Pig is alarmed and worried that her son was not harmed. Grunty Pig is unimpressed and boastfully declares that he would as soon meet a bear as the Muley Cow. His mother is uneasy and wishes Farmer Green would come and put them back in their pen.
