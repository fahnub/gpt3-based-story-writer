Fatty Coon is out looking for food and climbs a tall hemlock to take a nap. He wakes uphungry and climbs over to a neighboring tree to look for a crow's nest. Inside the nest, he finds four white eggs and starts to eat them. Suddenly, he is attacked by a goshawk and sustains injuries from the bird's claws. He runs home to tell his mother what happened. Mrs. Coon scolds him for eating the goshawk's eggs and points out that they are a different color than crow's eggs. Fatty only remembers how good they tasted.
