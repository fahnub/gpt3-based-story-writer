Mister McCune, Old Uncle Strong, Benjamin Biddle, and Captain O'Trigg are all performers who are putting on a free show for the children. Each performer does their own thing - McCune whistles a tune, Uncle Strong sings a song, Biddle plays the fiddle, and O'Trigg dances a jig. At the end, the narrator says that they will also tell a fable if they are able.
