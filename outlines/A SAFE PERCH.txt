Turkey Proudfoot tries to teach six geese the "stylish strut," but they are too stupid to learn and instead follow him around the farmyard. The other animals on the farm think that the geese are chasing Turkey Proudfoot and start to crow and squawk. Turkey Proudfoot leads the geese to a tree and orders them to stay there, then tells the other animals that he ordered the geese to go for a swim. The hen turkeys and hens start to argue over whether Turkey Proudfoot was running away or leading the geese. Turkey Proudfoot tells them off from his perch in the tree, saying that the geese are too stupid to learn anything and that they'll waddle around for the rest of their lives.
