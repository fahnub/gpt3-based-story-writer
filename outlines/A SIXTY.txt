In this story, Mr. Frog is a tailor who measures the Beaver family for new suits. The Beaver family is so pleased with the prospect of having new clothes that they all want to be measured multiple times. Mr. Frog is able to measure them quickly and takes down the measurements on flat, black stones. However, he is troubled because none of the customers have brought their pocket-books with them.

Mr. Frog asks Grandaddy Beaver why they didn't bring their pocket-books and Grandaddy Beaver says he must have made a mistake in telling them. Mr. Frog tells him it's no problem and to just bring them when they come to have their clothes fitted.

 Mr. Frog continues measuring the customers but he becomes uneasy again when he realizes that he has been measuring them for over an hour and there are still just as many customers left. He decides he must stop soon because he is going to a singing-party and doesn't want to be late.

However, the customers don't want him to leave and they begin to jostle and push each other inside the tailor's shop. In order to get rid of them, Mr. Frog works faster than ever and makes mistakes in the measurements. Finally, he stops when he realizes he has already measured Grandaddy Beaver multiple times.

Mr. Frog doesn't say anything but he reaches for the tape measure and starts to measure Grandaddy Beaver again. Suddenly, the other customers see that Mr. Frog is swallowing the tape measure and they cry out in dismay. The tape measure disappears inside Mr. Frog's mouth and he is unable to continue working.

The customers file out of the shop, asking Mr. Frog how it happened. He tells them the tape measure stuck to his tongue and that everything does. He also says that he was hungry and that he feels better now.

Despite the setback, Mr. Frog is still able to make it to the singing-party on time.
