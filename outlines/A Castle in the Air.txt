Master Meadow Mouse is always on the move, and the latest place he decides to call home is in the cornfield. He is pleasantly surprised to find that many of his cousins have had the same idea, and there are plenty of shocks of corn for everyone to choose from.

Master Meadow Mouse settles into a huge shock of corn near the bank of Broad Brook and makes himself a nest of dry husks. He is content with his new home, and happy to have plenty of food stored away for when he gets hungry.
