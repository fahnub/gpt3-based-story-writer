Jasper Jay and Reddy Woodpecker are two birds who are fond of beechnuts. When Jasper Jay hears that Reddy Woodpecker is planning to spend the winter in the same area, he is furious and enlists the help of Jimmy Rabbit to drive Reddy away.

Jimmy Rabbit comes up with a plan and tells Jasper Jay to stand beside a cedar tree near a puddle of water. Jasper does as he is told, grumbling all the while.

Soon, Reddy Woodpecker appears on the scene. He is looking for beechnuts and is startled to see Jasper Jay standing there. When Reddy tries to get closer, Jasper Jay splashes him with water from the puddle.

Reddy is angry and tries to retaliate, but Jasper Jay is too quick for him. Every time Reddy tries to get close, Jasper Jay splashes him with water, until finally Reddy gives up and flies away.

Jasper Jay is triumphant and thanks Jimmy Rabbit for his help.
