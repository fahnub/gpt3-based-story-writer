Benny Badger is out hunting for Ground Squirrels when he comes across Mr. Fox. They chat for a bit, and Benny notices that Mr. Fox is very sly and doesn't say much. Benny decides to make him talk next time they meet.

The next day, Benny meets Mr. Fox again and asks him about birds' eggs. Mr. Fox tries to avoid the question, but Benny persists. Mr. Fox finally tells Benny to ask a Prairie Chicken about eggs, and Benny goes off in search of one.

Mr. Fox chuckles to himself, knowing that the Prairie Chickens won't tell Benny anything.
