Grandaddy Beaver goes to Ferdinand Frog for help in getting the Beavers new clothes. Ferdinand agrees, but is reluctant to give away his secret. He tells Grandaddy to meet him at the big rock on the other side of the pond that night and to bring everyone who wants to know how to get new clothes. Ferdinand says that everything will be made easy if they do as he says.
