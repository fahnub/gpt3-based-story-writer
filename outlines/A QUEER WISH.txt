Timothy Turtle is annoyed when he sees Johnnie Green fishing in his favorite pool in Black Creek. He watches as Johnnie catches three big fish, including the one Timothy was planning to eat for dinner. When Johnnie moves further up the creek, Timothy follows him, complaining to his neighbors along the way.

Peter Mink suggests that Timothy write a letter to Farmer Green, and Timothy agrees, telling Peter to find somebody to write it. When Timothy reaches the spot where Johnnie was fishing, he finds a string of seven pickerel that Johnnie has left there.

Timothy Turtle suddenly changes his mind about sending a letter to Farmer Green. He wishes that Johnnie would come there to fish every day. When Peter Mink meets Timothy the next day, Timothy tells him to go back and tell Mr. Crow that he hopes Johnnie Green will come twice a day to fish until he has caught every fish in Black Creek.
