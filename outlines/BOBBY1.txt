Everybody in Farmer Green's meadow liked Bobby Bobolink, except for old Mr. Crow. Bobby was known for his cheerful disposition and his dashing good looks. He was also known for being the best singer in the Pleasant Valley Singing Society.

Mr. Crow was jealous of Bobby because he was a better singer than Mr. Crow and because Bobby was friends with Mr. Red-winged Blackbird. Mr. Crow was also suspicious of Bobby because he had so many names - Bobby was known as the Reed Bird, the Rice Bird, and the Butter Bird in different parts of the world.

One day, Mr. Crow asked Mr. Red-winged Blackbird why Bobby had so many names. Mr. Red-winged Blackbird snapped at Mr. Crow, telling him that he was being stupid. Just then, Bobby himself arrived and the two friends started talking about the weather. Mr. Red-winged Blackbird was relieved that Mr. Crow hadn't started being disagreeable.
