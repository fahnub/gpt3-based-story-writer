Turkey Proudfoot is in the woods at night, trying to guess what Simon Screecher the owl is talking about. Simon Screecher eventually tells Turkey Proudfoot that he is talking about his beak, and Turkey Proudfoot gets angry. Simon Screecher tells Turkey Proudfoot that his beak is useless and that he would never be able to fight with it. Turkey Proudfoot gets angry and challenges Simon Screecher to a fight. Simon Screecher tells Turkey Proudfoot that he doesn't fight that way in the woods and that he would never be able to win a fight against him. Turkey Proudfoot is then scared when he hears Solomon Owl, Simon Screecher's cousin, coming. Turkey Proudfoot tells Simon Screecher to meet him tomorrow night instead.
