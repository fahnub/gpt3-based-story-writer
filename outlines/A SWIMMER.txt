Henrietta Hen is a mother who is trying to teach her child to swim in the duck-pond. However, the child seems to have no intention of minding her or of drowning. When Henrietta's neighbors come to see what the commotion is about, they tell her that the child is a duckling and that the water won't hurt him.

Henrietta is astonished but soon begins to boast about her son's swimming skills. However, her neighbors are unimpressed and tell her that they don't want any swimmers in their families. Henrietta then announces that every brood should have at least one swimmer in it.

The duckling continues to swim away and Henrietta is eventually forced to go home without him. Her own children ask about the duckling but Henrietta says that they are better off without him and that she never liked him very well.
