The long-awaited race between Grumpy Weasel and Jimmy Rabbit finally begins, with Jimmy taking an early lead. However, as the race goes on and on, Jimmy starts to tire while Grumpy seems to only be getting stronger. Jimmy starts to worry that Grumpy will catch up to him, and when he does, he'll be too tired to defend himself.

Old Mr. Crow sees the whole thing and comes up with a plan to help Jimmy. He tells Jimmy to run past Grumpy's house, and when Grumpy comes chasing after him, to lead him right into Mrs. Hen's yard. Mrs. Hen is known for being a fierce protector of her chickens, and when she sees a weasel chasing a rabbit, she'll be sure to chase the weasel away.

Jimmy follows Mr. Crow's plan and it works perfectly. Grumpy is so focused on catching Jimmy that he doesn't even see Mrs. Hen until she's already attacking him. Jimmy escapes while Grumpy is being chased away, and he finally has a chance to rest.
