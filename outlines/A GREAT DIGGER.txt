Benny Badger lives on the high, dry plains and loves to dig holes. His small neighbors, the ground squirrels and prairie dogs, wish he would go away. Benny is too bulky to fit into their tunnels, but he doesn't let that stop him. He is a peaceable creature, but if a dog ever tries to bother him, he will fight back with his sharp teeth. Benny is mostly active at night, and during the day he likes to sun himself. If a ground squirrel ever notices him and stares curiously, Benny will awake and turn his head, causing the squirrel to run away. Benny's face is black and gray with a white underbelly, and he is always well-groomed with his fur neatly parted in the middle.
