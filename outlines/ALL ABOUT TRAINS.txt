Freddie is hesitant at first, but Mrs. Ladybug assures him that he will be able to stop the trains before they run over him. Freddie decides to try it out and sets off for the railroad track. When he gets there, he waves his light in front of an oncoming train. The train does not stop and Freddie is killed.
