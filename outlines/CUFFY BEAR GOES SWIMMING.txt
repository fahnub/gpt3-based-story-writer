Cuffy Bear is being chased by bees and he runs to the brook to escape them. He jumps into the pool in the middle of the brook, but the bees follow him and keep stinging him. Cuffy has to keep his head underwater to avoid them, but he gets tired and has to come up for air. He tries to hide in a shallow part of the pool, but the bees find him and keep stinging him. Cuffy stays in the pool until sundown when the bees finally leave. He is very cold and his face feels like it's on fire, but he makes his way home.
