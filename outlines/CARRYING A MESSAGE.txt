Paddy Muskrat and his wife tell the Muley Cow about the dangers of sunstroke, and the Muley Cow tries to stay in the shade for the rest of the day. Later, Tommy Fox comes trotting out of the woods and speaks to the Muley Cow, asking her to carry a message to Turkey Proudfoot. The Muley Cow agrees, and when she goes to deliver the message, Turkey Proudfoot gets angry, scolding her for trying to get him into trouble with Tommy Fox. It seems that Tommy Fox is planning a surprise for Turkey Proudfoot, but Turkey is not looking forward to it.
