Buster Bumblebee is out collecting nectar from a clover patch when he is suddenly grabbed by what he thinks is a Robber Fly. He screams for help, but nobody comes. He is about to be eaten when he is suddenly released and falls to the ground. He hears a commotion and buzzing behind him, but he is too scared to look. He eventually makes it home, where he finds the whole family in an uproar. He learns that the Robber Fly did indeed come to the clover patch, but it was Peevish Peggy who was almost eaten, not him. He is laughed at by the other bees for his mistake, and he is never again able to mention the Robber Fly's name without feeling embarrassed.
