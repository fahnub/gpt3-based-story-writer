Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.
