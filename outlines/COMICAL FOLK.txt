In a cottage in Fife lived a man and his wife who were comical folk. They both saw with their eyes and their tongues moved whenever they spoke. When they were asleep, they could not contrive to keep their eyes open. They both walked on their feet and it was thought that what they ate helped, with drinking, to keep them alive.
