Fatty Coon is hiding behind some tall rushes near a creek, hoping to catch a frog. He instead spies Mrs. Turtle and watches as she climbs out of the water, digs a hole in the sand, and then lays a bunch of eggs in it. She covers the eggs back up with sand, splashes back into the creek, and swims away.

As soon as Mrs. Turtle is gone, Fatty Coon trots over to the spot where she was just standing and starts digging in the sand. He quickly discovers the turtle eggs and starts eating them all up. He's happy that he got to eat the delicious eggs, but he knows he's in for it when Mrs. Turtle comes back and finds them all gone.
