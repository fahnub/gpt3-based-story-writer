Fatty Coon's mother is worried he will get into trouble when he leaves the house at night, but he is only going to the loggers' camp to look for food. He finds plenty of scraps and leftovers to eat, including a box of evaporated apples. He doesn't know what they are, but eats them anyway. He drinks a lot of water from the brook and feels full and bloated.

He goes home and his mother is worried he has been poisoned. He tells her what he ate and she realizes he has just been overeating and that he will be fine.
