The speaker begins by addressing their love interest, telling them to smile on them and shine their light on them. The speaker then turns to despair, saying that their soul is lost and they are willing to pay the price. The speaker continues, saying that their love interest is surrounded by beauty and luxury, while they themselves can only dream of such things. The speaker laments that they have forgotten everything but their love interest, and they pray to God to be as the happy, honest men in their graves.
