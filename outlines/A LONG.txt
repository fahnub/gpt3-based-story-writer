Ferdinand Frog meets a Great Blue Heron and is impressed by the size of his bill. The heron tells Ferdinand that he is moving into the area and Ferdinand is immediately worried that the heron will eat him. The heron reassures Ferdinand that he is not interested in eating frogs and the two become friends. Ferdinand is amazed by the heron's bill and says that it would be useful for making button-holes. The heron is amused by this comment and flies away.
