Turkey Proudfoot is in the farmyard when he hears a strange gobbling noise. He is worried that he made the noise himself, but the rooster assures him that he did not. The gobbling noise happens again, and Turkey Proudfoot is convinced that there is another turkey around.

He goes to the farmhouse to investigate and finds a green bird in a cage who is making the noise. The bird introduces itself as Polly and Turkey Proudfoot is not impressed. He tries to attack the bird, but ends up getting scolded by the hired man.

Turkey Proudfoot sulks behind the barn, muttering about the bird. He is angry that the bird is called Pretty Polly when he thinks it should be called Turkey Bird.
