A little cock-sparrow sits on a green tree, chirping away merrily. A naughty boy comes along with his wee bow and arrow, intending to shoot the little bird and make a stew out of him.

The cock-sparrow pleads with the boy not to make him into a stew, and so the boy relents and lets the bird fly away.
