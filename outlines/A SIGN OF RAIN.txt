Grandfather Mole finds an old log by the garden fence and decides to make it his home. Sandy Chipmunk, who is already living in the log, greets Grandfather Mole politely. Sandy tells Grandfather Mole that it is going to rain soon, even though there are no current signs of rain. Grandfather Mole scoffs at this prediction, saying that Sandy is too young and inexperienced to know anything about the weather.

Sandy Chipmunk explains that he saw Farmer Green's cat washing her face on the doorsteps, which is a sure sign of rain according to Sandy's mother. Grandfather Mole scoffs at this prediction as well, saying that the cat is not a trustworthy person. Sandy Chipmunk retorts that if the cat wants to wash her face, she can just stick her head out in the rain. Grandfather Mole then claims that anyone who washes their face in anything but dirt is stupid.

Sandy Chipmunk thinks for a moment and then tells Grandfather Mole that the only person he knows who would agree with him is Johnnie Green. Grandfather Mole is pleased with this answer, and the two animals sit in companionable silence for the rest of the day.
