Miss Kitty Cat sets out on a journey to return home, crossing fields and roads and dodging wagons. She pauses to drink from a brook and eat a meal before continuing on her way. She spends some time teasing birds in a wood before moving on. As she nears home, she becomes homesick and her pace quickens. She eventually reaches the familiar sights of Blue Mountain and Pleasant Valley, and her home at Farmer Green's.
