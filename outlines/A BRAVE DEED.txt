The Muley Cow is generally considered to be a timid creature, but she surprises everyone when she takes on Jack O'Lantern, a fearsome creature who has been terrorizing the farm. After Johnnie Green goes to bed, Jack O'Lantern spends the night sitting on a fence post, grinning at the black night. Nobody dares to go near him, except for Benjamin Bat.

After a while, Jack O'Lantern vanishes, and in the morning Miss Kitty Cat claims to have seen him still sitting on the fence post. When broad daylight comes, however, Jack O'Lantern has vanished completely.

The Muley Cow eventually confesses that she was the one who took care of Jack O'Lantern, and everyone is astonished at her bravery.
