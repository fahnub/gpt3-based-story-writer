Dickie Deer Mouse is busy gathering cat-tail down in Cedar Swamp to line his nest with. He makes a roof out of moss and is very proud of his home. All his Deer Mouse relations think it's a great house, but the birds think it's a trap. Dickie is happy in his home and likes to watch the goings-on from inside with just his head poking out. He knows he needs to be vigilant, as he is often the prey of owls and other predators. If they knew he was inside his home, they could easily tear it apart, but luckily they don't know.
