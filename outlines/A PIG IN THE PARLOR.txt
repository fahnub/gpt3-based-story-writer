Grunty Pig escapes from his pen and enters the farmhouse, where he finds and eats some delicious doughnuts. He then explores the house and ends up in the parlor, where he meets Moses Mouse. The two of them chat for a bit before Moses runs off and Grunty accidentally tips over a lamp, breaking it.

Farmer Green's wife comes into the room and sees the mess. She is not happy to find a pig in her parlor and shoos him out of the house. Grunty Pig thinks she is mad at him because he told tales on Moses Mouse and swears to be more careful in the future.

However, he never gets the chance to go back into the farmhouse again, as Farmer Green either keeps him penned up more carefully or he gets too fat to fit through any openings. Grunty Pig eventually becomes Farmer Green's "prize hog" and grows very fat indeed.
