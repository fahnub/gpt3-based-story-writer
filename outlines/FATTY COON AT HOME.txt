Fatty Coon is a young raccoon who is never satisfied with the food his mother brings him. He is always looking for something else to eat and is always getting into adventures as a result. One day, he goes off in search of food and comes across a frog. He tries to eat it but it jumps away. Fatty gives chase but the frog is too fast for him. Fatty is about to give up when he sees the frog jump into a deep pool of water. Fatty knows he can't swim so he gets an idea. He finds a long stick and ties it to his tail. Then he swings out over the pool of water on the stick and grabs the frog. He is so proud of himself that he takes the frog home to show his mother.
