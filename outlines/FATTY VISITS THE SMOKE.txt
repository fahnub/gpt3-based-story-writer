Fatty Coon is a raccoon who is very thin after a long winter of sleeping. He decides to go to Farmer Green's house to see if he can find anything to eat. He smells something delicious coming from a small, low building and goes inside. He finds a row of hams hung up to smoke and starts to eat one. Suddenly, he is thrown to the ground and the ham falls on top of him. He is very frightened and runs all the way home. He later realizes that he had simply bitten through the cord that was holding the ham up, and it fell on him when he tried to take a bite. His children love hearing the story of his adventure.
