Miss Kitty Cat wakes up from a nap and stretches. She then goes to the door and mews to be let out. Once outside, she explore the woodshed and decides it would be a good place to hunt in stormy weather.

She then hops down to the ground and notices how nice Farmer Green's yard is. She sees a movement in the grass and starts to creep towards it, hoping to catch a meadow mouse. However, she is surprised when old dog Spot appears and starts barking at her.

Miss Kitty runs away, with Spot in hot pursuit. She runs towards the barn and manages to lose him inside. However, he quickly corners her and she has to face him down.
