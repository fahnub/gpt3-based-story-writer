Kiddie Katydid and Benjamin Bat are having a chat in the tree-tops when Benjamin suggests they have some sports in Farmer Green's yard. Kiddie Katydid is a skilled jumper and flier and says he could do better at those sports later in the night. They agree to have the sports almost at dawn and Benjamin Bat says he will hang by his heels from a tree limb. Kiddie Katydid tells him not to worry and that he is sure Benjamin Bat will win.
