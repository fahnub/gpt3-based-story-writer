Turkey Proudfoot meets the new peacock on the farm and is immediately intimidated by him. The peacock is much larger than Turkey and has a beautiful, full tail. Turkey tries to talk to the peacock, but he is met with silence. Henrietta Hen tells Turkey that the peacock is likely dumb and Turkey should be polite to him. The peacock then screams, startling both Turkey and Henrietta. They both understand that the peacock is not dumb, but his voice is so terrible that they can't understand what he's saying. The peacock tells Turkey that he is not a barnyard fowl and doesn't belong with the other farm animals. Turkey is hurt and angry by this, but he doesn't dare confront the peacock because he is so big and scary. The peacock walks away and Turkey is left feeling humiliated.
