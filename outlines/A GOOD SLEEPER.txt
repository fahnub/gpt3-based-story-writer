Twinkleheels is a young horse who is annoyed with his neighbor, Ebenezer, an old horse who is always falling asleep. Twinkleheels is determined to teach Ebenezer a lesson by racing him and showing him how fast he can go. However, Ebenezer is a very experienced horse and easily defeats Twinkleheels. Afterwards, Ebenezer explains to Twinkleheels that he is successful because he always pays attention and mind his own business - something that Twinkleheels still has to learn.
