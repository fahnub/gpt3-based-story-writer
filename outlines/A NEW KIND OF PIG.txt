Grunty Pig tumbles through a hole in a fence and is found by old dog Spot, who promises to show him twelve pigs without tails. Grunty is amazed to find that the pigs in the cage have no tails, and he accuses old Spot of trying to trick him. Johnnie Green, the owner of the pigs, comes out and tells them to leave. Grunty and Spot don't see each other for a week, and when they finally meet again, Spot is ashamed of himself for what he did.
