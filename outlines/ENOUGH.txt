Mrs. Ladybug is trying to take Jennie Junebug to task for eating the leaves of Farmer Green's trees, but Jennie is too rough and knocks the breath out of Mrs. Ladybug instead. Mrs. Ladybug sends Miss Moth to find Freddie Firefly and ask him for help. Freddie Firefly comes up with the idea to ask Jennie why she doesn't bump into Solomon Owl. Jennie likes the idea and does just that. Solomon Owl is not amused and goes looking for Jennie. Jennie hides until he leaves, then announces she is moving away and is never seen again on Farmer Green's property.
