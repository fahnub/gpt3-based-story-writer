A group of wolves approach an elephant, asking for permission to take a small contribution of wool from the sheep in order to make coats for winter. The elephant agrees, but warns them to take only what they need and not to harm the sheep. The wolves take a fleece from each sheep, but also take an extra hair from each one. The sheep cry out in protest, but the wolves ignore them and continue taking what they need.
