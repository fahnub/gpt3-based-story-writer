Brownie Beaver eagerly awaits the return of Mr. Crow every Saturday so that he can hear the news from Pleasant Valley. Mr. Crow lists off all of the events that have transpired during the week, including that Peter Mink caught a monstrous eel, Fatty Coon was sick from eating too many dried apples, Mrs. Bear had a birthday, and Mr. Woodchuck went to visit his cousins in the West. Brownie Beaver is so eager to hear more that he interrupts Mr. Crow, who then refuses to continue until next Saturday.
