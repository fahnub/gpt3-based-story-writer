Frisky Squirrel is being chased by Mr. and Mrs. Hawk, and is getting tired and scared. He calls for his mother, but she is not home. He tries to make a run for his home in a hickory tree, but the hawks won't let him. Suddenly, Mr. Kinglet, a small olive-green bird, comes to his rescue, pecking Mr. Hawk on the back and driving the hawks away. Frisky Squirrel make it safely home, and the forest-people all thank Mr. and Mrs. Kinglet. Frisky Squirrel is ashamed of how he has teased Mrs. Kinglet in the past, and promises to never bother her again.
