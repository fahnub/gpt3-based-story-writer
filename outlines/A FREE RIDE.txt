Grumpy Weasel is hiding in a jug to escape Henry Hawk, when he is discovered by Farmer Brown. Old dog Spot smells Grumpy and starts to whine and yelp, but Farmer Brown cannot understand him. Farmer Brown loads the jug onto his wagon and sets off for home, with Grumpy still inside.

Grumpy Weasel is angry at being kidnapped, and even more so when he is left high up on a shelf in the barn. He escapes and gloats over old dog Spot, who was unable to catch him.
