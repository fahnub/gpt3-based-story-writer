In this delightful poem, a bundle of hay, a johnny-cake from Rome, and a man and mule from Ultima Thule set off on a journey home. Along the way, they encounter various obstacles and challenges, but ultimately make it home safe and sound. Along the way, the reader is treated to playful illustrations and a fun rhyming scheme.
