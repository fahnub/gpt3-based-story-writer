Farmer Green's latest outing for Mrs. Pig and her family turns into a nightmare when Grunty runs away and is chased by a bear. Mrs. Pig is frantic with worry, but Grunty eventually makes it back to the yard unharmed. Mrs. Pig is relieved but also angry, and she scolds Grunty for his recklessness. Grunty promises to stay put, but he soon runs off again and is chased by the bear once more. This time, Mrs. Pig accompanies him as he runs back to the fence, and she is relieved to see that the bear does not follow them. Mrs. Pig decides that it is time to tell Farmer Green about the bear, and Grunty volunteers to go and tell him.
