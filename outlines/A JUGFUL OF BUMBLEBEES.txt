The Bumblebee family is out in the meadow when they notice a jug. Buster Bumblebee is curious about the jug and goes to investigate. He hears a roaring noise from inside the jug and tells the other bees that there is an enemy inside. The bees all fly into the jug and are subsequently captured by Johnnie Green. Johnnie takes the jug and shakes it, then sets it down and goes to get more water. The bees inside the jug start to stir and eventually fly out. They are disoriented and don't know what happened. The other bees blame Buster for the incident and are forever remarking on how lazy and stupid he is.
