Henrietta Hen is a self-proclaimed "speckled beauty" who is very proud of her accomplishments, no matter how small. She is always boasting about how she is the best at everything, and she gets very angry if anyone suggests otherwise. Henrietta is especially proud of her eggs, and she loves to tell everyone about her latest laying.

One day, Henrietta is bragging to Polly Plymouth Rock about her eggs when Polly points out that Henrietta doesn't even know how to make an omelette. This shuts Henrietta up for once, and she goes home feeling embarrassed.
