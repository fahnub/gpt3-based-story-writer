Mr. Elephant and Mr. Frog are courting at one house. One day, Mr. Frog tells the sweetheart of Mr. Elephant that Mr. Elephant is his horse. When Mr. Elephant comes at night, the girls tell him what Mr. Frog said. Mr. Elephant then goes to Mr. Frog's house and asks if he said that Mr. Elephant is his horse. Mr. Frog denies saying this, and they go together to find the sweetheart of Mr. Elephant.

On the way, Mr. Frog tells Mr. Elephant that he is too weak to walk and asks to be carried on his back. After a while, Mr. Frog asks Mr. Elephant to stop so he can tie him up with cords. Mr. Elephant agrees, and Mr. Frog does so. Later, Mr. Frog asks Mr. Elephant to stop again so he can get a green twig to fan mosquitoes away. Mr. Elephant agrees, and Mr. Frog does so.

When they are about to arrive, the girls see them and go to meet them with shouting, saying that Mr. Elephant is indeed the horse of Mr. Frog.
