Rusty Wren is awakened by Mr. Chippy and his 16 cousins, who are pounding on his door and demanding Rusty hand over Chippy, Jr. When Rusty explains that Chippy, Jr. is too big to fit through the door, Mr. Chippy and his cousins become angry and threaten to force their way into Rusty's house and cause trouble. Johnnie Green, who lives in the farmhouse nearby, notices the commotion and comes to investigate. When he learns that there is a chippy sparrow inside Rusty's house, he shinned up the old cherry tree to take a look. He saw Chippy, Jr.'s head peeking out of the syrup can and called down to his father to tell him. Farmer Green handed Johnnie a can-opener and told him to cut the end off the can so he could reach in and get the chippy. Johnnie did as he was told and Chippy, Jr. was quickly freed. He flew away to his home in the wild grapevine on the stone wall. The Wren family was glad to be rid of their troublesome guest but were not happy about the state of their house. Johnnie Green bent the tin back into place and Rusty and his wife discovered that Johnnie was a good friend to have.
