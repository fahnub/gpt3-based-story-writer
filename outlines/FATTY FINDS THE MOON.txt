Wandering through the woods, Fatty Coon's bright eyes catch a strange gleam from something that is shining and glittering out of the green. Fatty hurries to see what the strange thing is and finds that it is the moon! He is so excited that he runs home to tell his mother, and his brother Blackie, and Fluffy and Cutey, his sisters.

Mrs. Coon is puzzles and walks close to the shining moon to examine it. She realizes that it is a trap that has been set by Farmer Green, or his boy, in hopes that one of her family will see it and fall into the trap. Mrs. Coon hurriedly leads her family away from the spot and back home.
