Twinkleheels is a small pony who is very fast and playful. He loves to run and play with his friends, and is always up for a race. One day, he is challenged by a horse to a race and wins easily. His friends are impressed by his speed and stamina, and old dog Spot is particularly impressed, having initially thought Twinkleheels was a toy pony.

Twinkleheels is always up for a challenge, and is never lazy. One day, he takes Johnnie Green to the village in a new buggy and wins a race there, much to old Spot's surprise.

Miss Kitty Cat is also impressed by Twinkleheels, and admires his quickness. However, she is not as fond of old Spot, and often lets him know it.
