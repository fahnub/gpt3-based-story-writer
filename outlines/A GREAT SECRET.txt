The story is about a mysterious character named Katy, who is only known by Kiddie Katydid and his family. Every night, the Katydids sing a repetitive chant about Katy doing something, but nobody outside of the family knows what Katy actually did. One night, Johnnie Green, who is bothered by the Katydids' noise, sticks his head out of the window and yells at them to stop, admitting that Katy did whatever it is that they're chanting about. The Katydids are offended by this and decide that Johnnie is rude for not respecting their nighttime singing.
