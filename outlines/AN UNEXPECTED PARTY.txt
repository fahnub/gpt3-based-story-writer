Nimble's mother is taking him to Farmer Green's carrot patch to have his first taste of carrots. However, she is surprised and dismayed to find that dozens of other forest folk are also coming along. She tries to send them all away, but Nimble begs her to let them stay.

She reluctantly agrees, but is worried about old dog Spot. Sure enough, Spot starts barking and chasing them all around the farm. They all finally escape and Nimble's mother is very angry with him.

However, the other animals are all very excited about the adventure and say they'll come back anytime Nimble's mother wants. She tells them it won't be anytime soon, and they all go their separate ways.
