Brer B'ar has a big, warm house, and his family of four live together happily. One day, there's a knock at the door and it turns out to be Brer Polecat, who wants to move in. Brer B'ar is hesitant, but eventually agrees, and Brer Polecat moves in.

Brer Polecat is a terrible housekeeper and makes a mess of the place. Brer B'ar's family can't stand it and eventually they all have to move out. Brer Polecat takes over the house and lives there by himself, until one day he, too, has to leave because he's made such a mess of things.
