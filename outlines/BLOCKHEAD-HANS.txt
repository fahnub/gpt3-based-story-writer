A princess announces that she will marry the man who can choose his words the best, and two of the squire's sons set out to win her hand. The brothers are both learned and think they are sure to win, but they are bested by their blockheaded younger brother, Hans. Hans gives the Princess a dead crow, an old wooden shoe, and some mud, which amuses her so much that she chooses him as her husband. The two brothers are furious, but Hans is crowned and lives happily ever after with his new wife.
