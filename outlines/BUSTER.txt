Buster Bumblebee's mother, the Queen, is worried that her workers won't make enough honey for the family's needs. Buster Bumblebee speaks up and says that he knows of a plan that could help - the honey-makers could work after dark if the Firefly family furnished lights for them.

The Queen liked the idea and sent Buster to talk with Freddie Firefly. Freddie Firefly agreed to help and soon the honey-makers were able to work after dark. Buster Bumblebee was very proud of himself and his successful plan.
