Timothy Turtle lives in Black Creek and is very fond of fishing. He is also fond of frogs and ducklings, much to the chagrin of the mother birds in the area. One day, Long Bill Wren, who lives among the reeds on the bank of the creek, has a close call with Timothy Turtle. His mother scolds him and tells him to be more careful in the future. Long Bill grows up and has children of his own. He often tells them stories of his close call with Timothy Turtle and warns them to be careful around the creek.
