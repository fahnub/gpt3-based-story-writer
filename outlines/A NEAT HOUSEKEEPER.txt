Rusty Wren's wife is a very neat housekeeper. She cleans the house every day, and is always chirping while she works. Sometimes her voice is sweet and pleasant, but at other times it is not so pleasant. Whenever Rusty hears the second kind of chirp, he is always careful to find some errand that takes him away from home.

Rusty is not so orderly as his wife. Often he scatters things about the house in a very careless fashion. For instance, if he notices a bit of moss or a burr on his coat, he will brush it off and let it fall on the floor. And when Mrs. Rusty finds anything like that in her cottage, she always knows how it got there.

Rusty sometimes remarks that it is a good thing he doesn't smoke. He knows that his wife would not be pleased if he did.

One day, after Rusty has come home from an excursion to the pasture, Mrs. Rusty begins sniffing the air. She looks at her husband suspiciously and says that she believes he has been smoking. Rusty begins to fidget and says that it must be the smoke of a pine stump that she notices. But Mrs. Rusty is not convinced and continues to scold him.

Just then, Rusty notices a bit of something clinging to one of his tail feathers. Without thinking, he flicked it onto the floor. When Mrs. Rusty sees it, she is even more sure that her husband has been smoking. She screams at him that it is tobacco, and Rusty knows that he is in trouble.
