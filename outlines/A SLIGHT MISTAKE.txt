Mrs. Woodchuck is telling her Aunt Polly Woodchuck about the Muley Cow's new poke bonnet when they are interrupted by old Mr. Crow. He tells them that the Muley Cow is actually wearing a poke, not a poke bonnet. Aunt Polly and Mrs. Woodchuck are embarrassed and try to leave, but the Muley Cow calls them back and asks how they found out about the poke. Mrs. Woodchuck tells her it was old Mr. Crow who told her, and the Muley Cow says she'd like to have a talk with him.
