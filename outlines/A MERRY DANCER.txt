Freddie Firefly is a small, sprightly creature who loves to dance and play at night. He is often joined by his family and friends, and they flash their lights through the darkness, enjoying the warm summer nights.

However, not everyone appreciates Freddie and his merry dancing. Benjamin Bat is one of those who find fault with the fireflies, and he grumbles that they should be spending their time in a more serious way.

Solomon Owl claims that there is another reason why Benjamin doesn't like Freddie Firefly - Benjamin would like to eat Freddie, but he doesn't dare to grab him for fear of getting burned by Freddie's light.

If this is true, then it's no wonder that Freddie keeps flashing his light in the darkness. And it's lucky that he has a light, because he is a night-prowler.

Unlike Farmer Green, Freddie believes that the night air is very healthful, and he often remarks that the pollen he eats tastes best when the dew is on it.

Johnnie Green, who goes to bed early, envies Freddie Firefly and all his sprightly company. Johnnie thinks it must be great fun to frolic the whole night long - if only Solomon Owl wouldn't scare everyone with his unearthly hooting.

But Freddie Firefly doesn't bother his head over Solomon Owl. Perhaps he knows that Solomon is too busy hunting for mice to take notice of anybody so small as he is, even if he does carry a bright light everywhere he goes.
