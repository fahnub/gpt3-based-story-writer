Timothy Turtle is a wild creature who lives in Pleasant Valley. He occasionally goes on excursions to different parts of the valley, but always returns to Black Creek. The other animals in the valley do not particularly like Timothy, as he is grumpy and never works.

One day, Timothy arrives in the Beaver colony and announces that he will be staying for a week. The Beavers are not pleased, as they are busy creatures who do not like Timothy's lazy ways. However, Grandaddy Beaver reminds them that Timothy has been to the colony before and has never harmed anyone.

 Brownie Beaver, a young member of the colony, thinks that somebody should make Timothy Turtle mend his ways. He believes that Timothy is old enough to know better than to be so lazy.
