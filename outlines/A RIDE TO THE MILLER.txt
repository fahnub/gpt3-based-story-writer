Johnnie Green and his grandmother are on their way to the miller's with a sack of wheat when they are joined by an unexpected passenger - Sandy Chipmunk. Sandy has stowed away in the sack of wheat and begins to eat his fill, intending to take the rest of the wheat home with him. However, before he can finish his meal, the sack is tied up and he is forced to ride along in the wagon, cowering in fear.

The ride is a bumpy one, and Sandy is terrified the whole way. Eventually, the wagon hits a bump and Grandmother Green screams. Johnnie begins to cry, and Sandy is even more scared. He has no idea what is happening.
