Brownie Beaver is out walking in the woods, trying to forget about the impending storm that is going to destroy his home. He comes across a clearing where loggers have been at work, and he is so angry at the sight of all the stolen trees that he doesn't even remember the storm. He trips on something and realizes that it is a chain that the loggers have left behind. He hurries back to his village and uses the chain to save his house from the storm. When the storm doesn't come, he is so excited that he forgets all about the trees and goes to bed.
