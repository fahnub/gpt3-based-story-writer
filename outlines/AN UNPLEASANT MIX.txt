The Beaver family visits Mr. Frog's tailor shop, but he always keeps the door locked and the shades drawn. They can hear him giggling and snickering inside, but he never responds to their knocks and calls.

A notice appears on Mr. Frog's door one evening, announcing a fitting day for the Beaver family's new clothes. The young dandies even spend the night in front of the shop to be the first to try on their new clothes.

When Mr. Frog opens his door the next morning, he has to beg his eager customers to keep order. He quickly gets them into their new clothes, assuring each one that they fit perfectly, and telling them to wait in the back yard.

When Mr. Frog follows the last Beaver into the back yard, he finds that there is a frightful uproar outside. Each Beaver claims that there is something wrong with his new clothes. Mr. Frog declares that they are exactly as they should be, because they are bound to be in style in five years' time.

Ferdinand Frog tells the crowd that they are only not used to being dressed in that fashion. One Beaver, however, shouts angrily that he knows his suit isn't fashionable and that he won't accept it.
