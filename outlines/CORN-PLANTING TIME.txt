Sandy Chipmunk is searching for food in the spring and comes across Mr. Crow who is in a hurry and doesn't have time to talk. Sandy remembers what Uncle Jerry Chuck said about Mr. Crow going to the field where Farmer Green is planting corn and decides to run over and see what is going on. When he arrives, he sees that Mr. Crow is already there, eating the corn. Sandy Chipmunk begins to eat the corn as well and is soon joined by Mr. Crow who is angry that Sandy is there. Mr. Crow tells Sandy that the corn belongs to Farmer Green and Sandy should leave. Sandy Chipmunk tells Mr. Crow that there is enough corn for both of them and Mr. Crow starts to complain about Sandy being a nuisance. Suddenly, Mr. Crow sees Farmer Green coming and flies off in a hurry. Sandy Chipmunk stays and eats all the corn he wants and is never seen by Farmer Green. Mr. Crow is angry with Sandy for following him and eating the corn.
