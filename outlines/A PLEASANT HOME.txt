Rusty Wren and his wife are looking for a new home. Rusty finds an old hollow apple tree and a hole in a fence-rail, but his wife doesn't want to live so far from the farmhouse. She suggests that they build their nest behind one of the shutters, but Rusty is worried that somebody might come to the window and close the shutter, causing their nest to fall.

Rusty eventually finds a perfect spot for their nest nailed to a tree close to Farmer Green's bedroom window. His wife is delighted and they move in right away.
