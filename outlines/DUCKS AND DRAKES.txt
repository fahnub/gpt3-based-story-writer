A duck and a drake go to the bakery to buy a halfpenny cake. They have a penny to pay the old baker, but he insists on having two pennies. The duck and drake try to come up with the extra penny, but they don't have any money. They try to barter with the baker, but he's not interested. Finally, they offer to do a dance for him. He agrees and they perform a dance called "The Hop and Scotch."
