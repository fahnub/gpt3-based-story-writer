Mr. Ferdinand Frog is a tailor who is visited by Timothy Turtle, who wants him to make a new coat. Mr. Frog is initially reluctant, as he is afraid of Timothy Turtle, who has tried to make a meal of him in the past. However, Timothy Turtle assures him that he only wants a new coat and that he will do something handsome for Mr. Frog in return. Mr. Frog agrees, and Timothy Turtle tells him to come outside so that he can whisper to him. Mr. Frog pretends that he is deaf, so Timothy Turtle tells him that he can read what is carved on his shell. Mr. Frog starts to read it aloud, but Timothy Turtle interrupts him, saying that he doesn't want to hear any more. Timothy Turtle then waddles away, looking very fierce.
