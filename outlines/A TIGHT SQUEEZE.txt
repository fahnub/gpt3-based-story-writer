Fatty Coon is out for a walk when he comes across a turtle's nest. He's never seen turtle eggs before, so he decides to try one. Timothy Turtle, the father, comes home and is not happy to find Fatty Coon eating his eggs. He bites Fatty's paw and threatens to drag him down to the bottom of the creek. Fatty Coon manages to break free and runs away. He meets up with Mr. Crow, who teases him for getting into a fight. Fatty Coon swears he'll never see Timothy Turtle again.
