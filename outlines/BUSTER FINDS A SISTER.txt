Buster Bumblebee is a lazy bee who is content to lounge around and do nothing all day. One day, he is visited by his sister, the trumpeter, who informs him that he is a queen's son and a gentleman. Buster is surprised and shocked to learn that his sister is a member of the royal family. However, he is soon convinced that it is better for him to play the role of the gentleman than to try to work like the other bees. The trumpeter agrees to help Buster by stuffing his ears with cotton so that he can sleep through the morning trumpet resounding through the fields.
