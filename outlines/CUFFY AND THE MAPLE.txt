Cuffy Bear and his sister Silkie are playing and pretending to make maple-sugar. Cuffy wishes for some real maple-sugar and gets angry with the make-believe sugar. He trots down the mountainside and finds a little house in a clearing with a man coming in and out. Cuffy smells the sweet smell of maple-sugar and goes to the door of the sugar-house. He sticks his head inside and starts gulping mouthfuls of the sugar. The man comes back and sees Cuffy with his paws in the pan of bubbling syrup.
