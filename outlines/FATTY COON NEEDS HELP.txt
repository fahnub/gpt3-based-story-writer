Fatty Coon is in trouble and needs Dickie Deer Mouse's help. Dickie is hesitant to help, as he is afraid of Fatty, but he eventually agrees. It turns out that Fatty needs help getting out of the cornfield, as he is too fat to fit through the fence. Dickie helps him by getting a stick for him to use as a lever, and Fatty is finally able to get out.
