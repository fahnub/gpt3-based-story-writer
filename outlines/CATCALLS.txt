Miss Kitty Cat is perched on top of Rusty Wren's tin house, enjoying herself and teasing the birds, when she suddenly hears a strange catcall. She can't see where it's coming from, but the birds all start warning her about the mysterious stranger. Miss Kitty Cat is determined to find the source of the noise and teach them a lesson, but no matter where she looks, she can't find anyone.

The catcalls continue, moving from one place to another, and Miss Kitty Cat starts to wonder if there's simply a disembodied voice jeering at her. Finally, she comes face to face with the culprit: Mr. Catbird, who has been imitating a cat to tease her. The other birds all join in, making so much noise that Miss Kitty Cat retreats to the haymow to get away from them.
