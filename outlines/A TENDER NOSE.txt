Spot, an old dog, teases Miss Kitty Cat in the barn, despite her warnings. He finally provokes her enough that she scratches his nose, sending him running out of the barn in pain. Spot is relieved to find that the only witness to his humiliation is Henrietta Hen, who he knows is too stupid to tell anyone. He spends the rest of the morning nursing his wounds under the woodshed. Miss Kitty Cat, meanwhile, stays in the barn, thinking about how worthless Spot is.
