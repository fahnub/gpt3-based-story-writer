Henrietta Hen is the talk of the farm after she announces she is going to the county fair. Old Ebenezer the horse tells her to be sure to see the races, but Henrietta is more interested in the poultry show. She is planning to take all her chicks with her, but is hoping to keep her duckling hatchling a secret. On the day of the fair, they are all loaded into a wagon and taken to the fairgrounds. Henrietta and her chicks are put into a pen, where they meet other chickens and ducks. They spend the day exploring the fair and watching the races. Henrietta is especially excited to see the poultry show. At the end of the day, they are all loaded back into the wagon and taken home.
