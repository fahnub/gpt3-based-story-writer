Mr. Nighthawk approaches Kiddie Katydid with the hopes of seeing the insect jump, but Kiddie Katydid is uninterested. Kiddie Katydid tells Mr. Nighthawk that his family and friends have all left and he does not know where they are. Mr. Nighthawk then pressures Kiddie Katydid into finding Katy, another katydid, to jump for him instead. Kiddie Katydid slyly tells Mr. Nighthawk that Katy did something, but does not elaborate, and Mr. Nighthawk is left to wonder what Katy did. Kiddie Katydid then informs Mr. Nighthawk that Solomon Owl, who likes to eat chickens, often visits the farm buildings. Mr. Nighthawk is frightened and flies away.
