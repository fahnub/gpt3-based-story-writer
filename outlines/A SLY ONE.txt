Mrs. Ladybug and Daddy Longlegs go to warn Betsy Butterfly that they know she has been taking butter and eggs from Farmer Green. Betsy denies it, but Mrs. Ladybug points out that Daddy Longlegs has seen her with her face in the butter. Betsy then explains that she doesn't actually like butter, she just likes the smell of it. The crowd is relieved and goes home.
