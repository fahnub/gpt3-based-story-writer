The rats and mice on the farm think that Miss Kitty Cat is a terrible person because she loves to hunt them. However, they also think it's pleasant to have her around because she can predict the weather. When old dog Spot chases her, she can be quite fierce. But around the farmhouse, she is always polite and never makes a fuss.

Johnnie Green likes Miss Kitty and often pets her. If he were her size and she were his, she might play with him like she does with a mouse. But Johnnie Green never stops to think of anything like that.
