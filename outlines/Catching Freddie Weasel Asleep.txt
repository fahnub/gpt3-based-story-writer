Frisky Squirrel is trying to catch Freddie Weasel asleep in his hole in the bank. He is joined by Henry Skunk, who offers to help. Henry Skunk sticks his head in the hole to see if Freddie Weasel is asleep, and while he is doing so, Freddie Weasel sneaks up behind Frisky and bites him on the shoulder. Frisky yells for help, and Henry Skunk comes to his aid, biting Freddie Weasel on the back. Freddie Weasel runs away, and Frisky and Henry Skunk go their separate ways. Frisky learned his lesson and never tried to spy on anybody again.
