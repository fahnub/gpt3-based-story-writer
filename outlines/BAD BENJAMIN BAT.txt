Benjamin Bat has been eyeing Freddie Firefly for awhile and telling him how plump he is getting. One evening, they meet in Farmer Green's dooryard and Benjamin remarks how ready Freddie is to be eaten. Freddie retorts with a jab about Benjamin's topsy-turvy head, and Benjamin gets angry. They argue back and forth until Freddie makes a comment about how Benjamin was obviously thinking that Freddie is ready to be eaten. Benjamin is afraid to eat Freddie because of his light, which reminds him of a time when he almost got burned in a fire. He tries to get Freddie to put out his light so that the mosquitoes will stop bothering Farmer Green, but Freddie refuses.
