Betsy Butterfly is a famous butterfly who is known and loved by all the creatures who live in Pleasant Valley. However, the night-prowling creatures have only heard about her and have never seen her. Freddie Firefly is the only one who has seen her, and he has told all his friends how beautiful she is.

Dusty Moth is a young moth who has become obsessed with seeing Betsy Butterfly. He begs Freddie Firefly to help him, and Freddie agrees to talk to her on his behalf. However, he warns Dusty that Betsy is very shy and he may not be able to convince her to meet with him.

Sure enough, when Freddie talks to Betsy about Dusty, she is very hesitant. But she finally agrees to meet with him on the condition that they meet in the daytime, as she is afraid of the dark.

Dusty is thrilled and eagerly agrees. However, when the day of their meeting arrives, Dusty is nowhere to be found. Freddie Firefly goes looking for him and eventually finds him fast asleep in the sun.

Despite his best efforts, Freddie cannot wake Dusty up. He is so disappointed that he decides to give up on him and goes back to Betsy. When he tells her what happened, she is so touched by Dusty's dedication to seeing her that she agrees to meet with him at night after all.

The two meet in the dark and have a lovely conversation. Betsy is so charmed by Dusty that she agrees to see him again, and the two eventually become good friends.
