Daffodils are a beautiful flower that come in many colors. They have a long stem with a trumpet-shaped flower at the end. The center of the flower is often yellow, but the petals can be any color from white to pink to purple.

Daffodils are one of the first flowers to bloom in the spring. They grow in sunny areas and need well-drained soil.

You can plant daffodils in your garden and enjoy their beauty every spring.
