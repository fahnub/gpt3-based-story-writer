In the story, old Mr. Crow is talking to the Muley Cow about how lucky she is. He explains that he has to work hard to find food, and in winter it's especially difficult. The Muley Cow says that being a cow is not all fun, and Mr. Crow admits that he wouldn't like to be restricted like that. He also says that cows have it easier because they don't have to worry about being hunted. The Muley Cow points out that cows can't go where they please, and Mr. Crow says that they could jump the fence if they wanted to. The Muley Cow says that cows can't travel as far or as fast as crows can. Mr. Crow then starts to talk about how Farmer Green fills the silo with corn in the summer, and how the cows get to eat it in the winter.
