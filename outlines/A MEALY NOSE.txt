The bays in the barn are annoyed with Twinkleheels the pony because they think he is a lazy loafer who is always eating. Twinkleheels tries to explain that his mealy nose doesn't mean he's been eating meal, but the bays don't believe him.

One day, the bays are forced to walk on the tread mill for thrashing, and they are not happy about it. Twinkleheels tries to talk to them, but the thrashing machine is too loud for them to hear him.

Johnnie Green comes to the field and feeds Twinkleheels some of the newly thrashed oats. The bays see this and they are envious.

One of the bays says to his mate, "That pony has begun to eat up the new oats already. I hoped he'd have the decency to decline them when Johnnie Green offered him a taste."
