A mother has a young son whom she calls Blue Bell. She gives him simple tasks to do around the house, such as going upstairs to get a gold pin or going to the garden to pick some sage. Unfortunately, Blue Bell is quite clumsy and often winds up getting hurt in the process. One day, he is sent to the cellar to fetch some beer but comes back empty-handed, saying there is none there. The mother scolds him and sends him back to the cellar, where he presumably finds the beer and brings it back to her.
