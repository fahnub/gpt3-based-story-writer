Fatty Coon is a coon who likes to eat squirrels. The squirrels don't like him because he tries to eat them. One night, Fatty Coon climbs a tree in search of a squirrel to eat. He finds a hole in the tree and sticks his paw inside, only to be met with a sharp pain. He pulls his paw out to find that it was a tramp coon who had given him the pain. The tramp coon scolds Fatty and tells him to go home. Fatty goes home and never goes back to that tree again.
