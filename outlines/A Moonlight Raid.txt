Master Meadow Mouse is enjoying a party in the cornfield when they spot Fatty Coon approaching and everyone scatters. Master Meadow Mouse runs to his shock and curls up in his nest to try and take a nap. He feels safe since Mr. Crow has been visiting the cornfield everyday and has never bothered anyone.

Fatty Coon starts raiding the corn field, and Master Meadow Mouse complains each time he is woken up by the noise. Eventually, Fatty Coon tears down the entire shock that Master Meadow Mouse is hiding in and he is forced to flee. Fatty Coon catches him and eats him.
