Fatty Coon is out on a midnight stroll with his mother when she tells him she has a surprise for him - something to eat that is the best thing he's ever tasted. Fatty is excited and can't wait to try it.

They come to a field of tall green stalks and Mrs. Coon shows him the long, green ears of corn. Fatty is skeptical at first, but after taking a bite of the sweet, milky kernels he is hooked. He devours ear after ear of corn, until he is finally full.

Fatty asks his mother what the corn is called and she tells him it is called corn. He wonders why Freddie Bluejay doesn't like it, and his mother tells him it is probably because he was afraid Fatty would eat up the whole field. Fatty says he would like to eat all the corn in the world.
