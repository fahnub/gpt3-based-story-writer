In the story, "A Happy Thought", Brownie Beaver wants a newspaper to keep him up-to-date on the goings-on in Pleasant Valley, but the nearest one is too far away. Mr. Crow has the idea to start a newspaper just for Brownie Beaver, and agrees to fly over to Brownie's house every Saturday afternoon to deliver the news. Brownie is delighted with the arrangement, but Mr. Crow warns him that there may be times when he is unable to make it, due to bad weather, being sick, or other commitments.
