Johnnie Green and his grandmother are on their way to the miller's to get the wheat ground into flour when their horse, Ebenezer, breaks a strap on his harness and they nearly go tumbling down a hill. Johnnie finds a piece of string in his pocket to tie the harness back together and they continue on their way. When they reach the bottom of the hill, Johnnie's grandmother screams - she had felt something run up her back and jump off her shoulder, which turns out to be a chipmunk. The chipmunk had been in the sack of wheat and must have gotten in Johnnie's pocket when he was taking the string out. Sandy, the chipmunk, is glad to be out of the sack of wheat and sets off to find his way home.
