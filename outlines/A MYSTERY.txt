Snowball, a sheep, is knocked down by a black ram and decides he must be sheared. He goes to the pasture to find his old companions, but they are so changed by shearing that he can't tell who is who. He grins at them, and the big old dame scolds him, telling him he will be sheared too. Farmer Green comes in and Johnnie Green says he wants to shear Snowball himself. They go to the barn, but Johnnie decides to go fishing instead and Snowball is left un-sheared. The next morning, Johnnie comes back and corrals Snowball, leading him to the barn to be sheared. The black ram and the other sheep wait at the pasture bars for Snowball to return, but he comes back without his fleece.
