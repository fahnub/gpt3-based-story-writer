Cinderella is a kind and good girl who is treated poorly by her step-sisters and made to work as a servant in her own home. When the King of the land throws a ball, Cinderella's step-sisters go and Cinderella is left behind. She is visited by her Fairy godmother who transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, rats into horses and footmen, and Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown. Cinderella goes to the ball and meets the Prince. They dance together and fall in love. Cinderella must leave the ball before midnight or her gown will turn back into rags. She flees and loses one of her glass slippers. The Prince searches for her and finds the slipper. He declares that the woman who can fit the slipper shall be his bride. Cinderella's step-sisters try but fail. Cinderella tries on the slipper and it fits. She tells her story and is married to the Prince. They live happily ever after.
