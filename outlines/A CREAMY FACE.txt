Spot the dog is on the prowl to catch the thief who has been stealing Farmer Green's cream. He soon discovers that the culprit is Miss Kitty Cat, who has been sneaking into the buttery to lap up the cream. He exposes her to Mrs. Green, who then stops up the hole that Miss Kitty has been using to access the buttery. Miss Kitty goes back to lapping up her saucer of milk, and Spot teases her about knowing who the thief was all along.
