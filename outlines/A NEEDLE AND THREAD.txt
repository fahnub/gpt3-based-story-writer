Old Mother Twitchett was a one-eyed, long-tailed witch who was always getting her tail caught in traps. One day, she went to the market to buy a needle and thread so she could sew her tail back on. But when she got there, she found that she didn't have enough money to buy both a needle and thread. She asked the market-keeper if she could have just a needle, and he said yes. But then she asked for just a thread, and he said no. Old Mother Twitchett was so angry that she cursed the market-keeper and his family. The market-keeper's wife and children turned into frogs, and he turned into a toad.
