When Ben wakes up, he is confused to find himself in a bed in a house instead of his usual sleeping arrangements. He soon remembers that he ran away from the circus and Mrs. Moss took him in. He goes downstairs to find Mrs. Moss and her two daughters preparing breakfast. They all sit down to eat and then Mrs. Moss tells the girls to do their chores and Ben to chop some wood.

After they finish their chores, Mrs. Moss takes Ben to meet with the Squire. The Squire asks Ben a series of questions to test his skills and then offers him a job working with the cows. Ben is thrilled to have the job, as it means he gets to work with horses.

The Squire's man, Pat, shows Ben where to take the cows and gives him some other odd jobs to do. Ben is excited to get started on his new job. He drives the cows down to a pasture and enjoys the scenery along the way. He finds a torn leaf from a history book and resolves to ask the girls at school what it means.

He has a pleasant day working with the cows and trudging back to the house at the end of the day. He is excited to start his new job and learn more about the history leaf he found.
