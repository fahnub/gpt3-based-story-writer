Benny Badger encounters an owl who lives in a prairie dog hole. The owl is a grumpy fellow who tells Benny that he drove the prairie dog out of the hole and took it over for himself. Benny is not impressed with the owl or his house, and he tells the owl so. The owl gets angry and tells Benny to go dig a hole for himself and crawl inside. Benny likes this idea and decides to do just that.
