Mrs. Pig is distressed because her children are always putting their fore feet in the trough when they eat. She has tried to tell them to stop, but they don't seem to care. Her son Grunty tells her that sometimes there isn't any food left for him by the time he gets to the trough. Mrs. Pig explains that if everyone would just eat their share, there would be enough food for everybody.

Farmer Green notices how piggy the children are at the trough and comments to his son Johnnie. Johnnie likes to watch the pigs and tells his father that the black pig, Blackie, is the greediest. Farmer Green decides that something needs to be done to help the runt of the litter, Grunty.

The next day, Farmer Green makes a lid for the trough that has seven holes in it, one for each of Mrs. Pig's children. This way, everyone has their own space and there is no more jostling. Mrs. Pig is delighted with the improvement. Grunty likes it too, but Blackie is not happy because he can't stick his nose through two holes at the same time.
