Grandfather Mole is a queer old creature who lives in Farmer Green's garden. He is mostly blind and has very small ears, but he is a great digger and has made himself a large home underground. He mostly eats angleworms, which he finds by burrowing through the soil, but he is content to eat any grubs or worms he finds. He is happy with his life and only ever complains about the scarcity of angleworms.
