Fairy Tenderheart is weeping because she can't stand the fighting she sees going on in the world. Her sisters try to comfort her, but she is inconsolable. She asks an older fairy why men fight, and is told that they just do, and that there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Fairy Tenderheart is determined to find a way to help, and sets off on a journey to find the Oldest Fairy of All, who might be able to help her.

She finally finds her in a Magic Garden, and the Oldest Fairy tells her that the only way to stop war is with the Plant of Knowledge, which has the power to turn people against war. They set off to plant the seeds of the Plant of Knowledge in children's gardens all over the world, in the hope that they will grow up to be a new generation who will scorn war.
