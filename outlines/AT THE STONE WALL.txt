Chirpy Cricket and Freddie Firefly meet by a stone wall and discuss the upcoming torchlight procession. They are joined by Moses Mosquito, Kiddie Katydid, and Mehitable Moth. Chirpy Cricket gives a speech, outlining the plan for the procession. The insects will form a line along the stone wall and Chirpy Cricket will lead them around the farm and past Farmer Green's window. Freddie Firefly is worried that the procession won't be successful because Moses Mosquito, Kiddie Katydid, and Mehitable Moth don't have any lights, but Chirpy Cricket assures him that they will carry the banners.
