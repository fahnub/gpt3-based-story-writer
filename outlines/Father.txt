Father Lime-stick catches a Flower-pecker and is about to kill and eat it when the bird cries out, begging for its life. The bird promises to bring the old man a Bezoar-stone worth at least a thousand if he will let it go. The old man agrees and the bird flies off.

The bird perches on a tree and begins to preen its feathers, getting rid of the bird-lime. Presently the old man calls out, asking where the bird has gone and if it has the Bezoar-stone. The bird replies that it is too absurd to expect it to carry such a heavy stone, and that the old man should remember in future not to undertake an affair that is beyond his capabilities.
