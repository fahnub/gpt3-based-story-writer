Master Meadow Mouse is a plump little mouse who lives in Farmer Green's meadow. He is friendly with some of the other animals in the meadow, such as Paddy Muskrat and Billy Woodchuck, and is on the lookout for others, such as Peter Mink and Tommy Fox.

The only time Master Meadow Mouse is ever known to lose his temper is when Farmer Green mows the meadow. Under the high grass, Master Meadow Mouse had been able to run about his well-beaten paths unseen by hawks, but with the grass cut and raked, leaving only naked stubble, he can't hide.

After haying, Master Meadow Mouse has to be more careful than ever. He knows that the hawks will scan the meadow many times a day in hopes of catching a glimpse of his reddish-brown back. Luckily, he succeeds in dodging them.
