In this poem, the speaker invites the reader to come to a land where babies grow like flowers in the grass. These babies are happy and carefree, and they laugh at their own reflections in a mirror.

The speaker then invites the reader to come to the sea, where babies sail in ships made of pearl. These babies are carried by a golden wind to the west, and the speaker suggests that perhaps a baby brother will come sailing to the reader's own little girl.

This poem is a playful and whimsical look at babies and childhood. It speaks of the joy and innocence of these young creatures, and the hope that they will bring happiness to those around them.
