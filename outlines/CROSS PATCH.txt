Cross patch is a fun rhyming game for kids ages 0 to 3. The object of the game is to draw a picture of a cross on a piece of paper, then pass it to the next player. The next player then draws a line from the top of the cross to the bottom, and so on. The game is over when the last player draws a line from the bottom of the cross to the top, making a complete circle.
