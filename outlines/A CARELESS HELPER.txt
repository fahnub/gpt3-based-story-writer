They take turns digging tunnels and watching the back door of the squirrel's nest, but Mr. Coyote is not very successful at keeping watch. Benny gets frustrated and starts to dig all the tunnels himself while Mr. Coyote watches, but Mr. Coyote soon gets bored and falls asleep. Benny is angry and decides that he will have to find a new helper.
