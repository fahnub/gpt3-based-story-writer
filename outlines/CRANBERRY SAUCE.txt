Turkey Proudfoot is talking to Mr. Crow when Mr. Crow mentioned that he was going to go eat cranberries. Turkey Proudfoot has never eaten them before, and he is disgusted by the idea. Mr. Crow teases him by talking about how good they are, and how they go well with turkey. This makes Turkey Proudfoot even more upset, and he tells Mr. Crow off.
