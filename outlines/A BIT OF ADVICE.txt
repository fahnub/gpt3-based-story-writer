Fatty Coon has been warned by Mr. Crow that Farmer Green is going to set old dog Spot on him if he doesn't stay out of the cornfield. Fatty is reluctant to stay away from the cornfield because he loves corn, but he is even more afraid of being caught by the dog.

Dickie Deer Mouse tells Fatty that he has managed to stay away from the cornfield by focusing on something else that he loves - deer horns. Dickie explains that deer horns can be found in the woods, near the foot of a tree.

Fatty Coon is immediately eager to try this new method and begins searching for deer horns. He is soon successful in finding some, and Dickie Deer Mouse is happy to see that his advice has helped Fatty stay away from the cornfield.
