Cuffy Bear is planning to steal a pig from Farmer Green's pig pen. He knows he must be careful not to meet Farmer Green, his son Johnnie, or his hired man. Cuffy sees them all ploughing in a field and goes to the pig pen. He seizes a little white pig in his mouth and starts to run away. The pig makes a loud noise and Cuffy drops it and runs away. Cuffy is scared and decides he never wants to see or hear a pig again.
