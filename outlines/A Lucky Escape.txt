Master Meadow Mouse is drifting downstream on a board, when he is spotted by Mr. Great Blue Heron. Mr. Heron waits for the board to drift closer, intending to pluck Master Meadow Mouse off of it. Master Meadow Mouse is terrified, and decides to jump off the board and into the water. He hides beneath the board, and when Mr. Heron gives up searching for him, he swims to shore and makes his way back upstream. He is met by his cousin, who scolds him for his recklessness.
