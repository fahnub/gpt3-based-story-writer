Henrietta Hen is scratching for worms in a freshly ploughed and harrowed field when she is caught by Mr. Crow. He accuses her of stealing corn and she doesn't deny it. When he asks her why she doesn't speak, she tells him she is too proud to talk with him and that she doesn't care to be seen speaking to him. She tells him to ask the Rooster if he wants to know the answer to his question. She walks away with stately steps and Mr. Crow watches her with a baleful gleam in his eyes.
