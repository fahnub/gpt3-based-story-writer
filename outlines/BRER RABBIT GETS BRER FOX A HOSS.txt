Brer Rabbit is out and about early one morning when he comes across a sleeping horse. He knows that Brer Fox has been wanting a horse, so he goes to find him and tell him where he can find one. Brer Fox is excited at the prospect of getting a horse and sets off to find the animal.

When he arrives at the spot, Brer Rabbit tells him to tie the horse's tail to a tree so he can't get away. Brer Fox does as he's told and tries to get on the horse, but the horse is too strong for him and throws him off. Brer Rabbit laughs and tells him to try again, but the same thing happens.

Brer Fox is getting angry now and tells Brer Rabbit to hold the horse while he gets on. Brer Rabbit pretends to do as he's asked, but when Brer Fox is on the horse's back, he gives the animal a slap on the rump and sends him galloping off into the distance. Brer Fox is left angry and frustrated, while Brer Rabbit laughs at his expense.
