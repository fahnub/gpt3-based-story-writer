Trot and Cap'n Bill are guests of the mermaids, and are given a tour of the undersea palace. They are shown to their rooms, which are furnished with beautiful things made of shells and seaweed. They are served a delicious meal by lobster waiters, and then entertaine by the mermaids.

The next day, they are taken by Queen Aquareine to see the most interesting parts of the ocean. Along the way, they pass by many fierce and terrible creatures, but are protected by the Magic Circle that the queen has drawn around them. They visit King Anko, the sea serpent, and then return to the palace.
