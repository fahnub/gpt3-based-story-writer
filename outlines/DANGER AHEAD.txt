Jolly Robin and his wife are worried that Grunty Pig will uproot their apple tree, so they decide to get their second brood of children out of the nest as soon as possible. They ask Grandfather Mole how long it will take for Grunty Pig to uproot the tree, and he says that it will take seven young porkers. Jolly Robin and his wife are relieved and decide to take care of their children.
