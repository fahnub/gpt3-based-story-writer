Buster Bumblebee attends a party at Farmer Green's, where he sees a boy with a stomachache being led away by his mother. The guests continue to eat and talk, and Buster becomes bored. He then hears the sound of fiddles coming from the carriage house and goes to investigate.

Inside, he sees three men playing the fiddles and old dog Spot sitting in the doorway. Spot explains that there is going to be a dance and that the fiddlers are playing the music.

Buster enjoys the music and the dance that follows. He forgets all about the raising bee that he was supposed to be attending and has a great time.
