In this poem, a child observer sees the Knapperines, a group of small children, going down a hill in front of Mrs. Knapp's house. The children are all bundled up in winter clothing, including purple mittens, mufflers, and Knitted jersey caps. On the way back up the hill, the child sees Mrs. Knapp slapping each of the children, leading the child to believe that she is punishing them for gathering stickers in their caps.
