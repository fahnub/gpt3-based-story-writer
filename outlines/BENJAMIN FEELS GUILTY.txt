Benjamin Bat and Freddie Firefly face each other in Farmer Green's dark dooryard. Benjamin Bat tells Freddie Firefly not to bring Solomon Owl to his tree during the day, as he could be eaten. Freddie Firefly retorts that Benjamin Bat would be just as happy to be eaten by Solomon Owl as Freddie Firefly would be to be eaten by Benjamin Bat. This makes Benjamin Bat very sheepish, and Freddie Firefly knows that he is guilty. Freddie Firefly tells Benjamin Bat to leave and if he ever comes back, he will bring Solomon Owl to his tree. Benjamin Bat tries to get away, but is terrified of being burned by Freddie Firefly's light. Freddie Firefly is amused and dances around the dooryard. When he comes back, Benjamin Bat is gone and he is never seen again.
