Demian's  Fish  Soup  is  the  story  of  a  man  who  loves  fish  soup  so  much  that  he  can't  help  but  try  to  get  his  neighbor, Phocas, to eat as much as he can. Phocas, however, is full after just three platefuls and tries to politely decline any more. Demian is insistent, though, and eventually Phocas gives in and eats a fourth plateful. At this point, he's had enough and makes his escape, vowing never to come back.
