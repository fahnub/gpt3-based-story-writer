Spot, an old dog, doesn't like Miss Kitty Cat from the moment he meets her. He plans to chase her whenever he can, but is careful not to do so inside the farmhouse. Miss Kitty is also careful to stay away from Spot, knowing that he will try to bully her.

One day, Miss Kitty is taking a nap in a chair near a window when Spot sees his opportunity. He sneaks up on her, but she wakes up in time to escape. Spot is disappointed, but Miss Kitty is relieved.
