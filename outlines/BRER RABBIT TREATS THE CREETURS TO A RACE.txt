One day, while a little boy was playing near Uncle Remus's cabin, a black cloud appeared in the sky and began blowing a strong wind. Uncle Remus told the boy about a time when Brer Rabbit tricked the other animals into a race. 

On the day of the race, Brer Rabbit made the animals stand at different points along the road. Brer Dust started first, followed by Cousin Rain. Brer Dust kicked up so much dust that the other animals started coughing and sneezing. Cousin Rain caught up to Brer Dust and soaked him with mud. 

When the other animals could see again, they noticed that Brer Rabbit was dry. They chased after him, but he was too quick for them. In the end, Cousin Rain thought he had won the race, but Brer Dust had fallen in the mud and couldn't run anymore.
