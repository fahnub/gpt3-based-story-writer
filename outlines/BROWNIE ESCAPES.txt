The story is about Brownie Beaver, who is cutting down a tree near a pond when it falls on him. He struggles to free himself for a while, but then gets hungry and starts eating the bark of the tree. He then has the idea to gnaw through the tree, which he does, and then walks back to his village. His family is relieved to see him, but he doesn't tell them how he got free, as he knows it would be considered a disgrace.
