The Hermit Thrush decides to settle a dispute between his cousins, old Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay, by arranging a race between Bobby Bobolink and Benjamin Bat. The two birds are known for their respective talents - Bobby Bobolink is an agile flier, while Benjamin Bat is known for being able to travel long distances.

The Hermit Thrush first tries to persuade Benjamin Bat to change his habits and stay awake during the day, but when that doesn't work, he asks Bobby Bobolink to stay up at night. In the end, both birds agree to the race.

The race is held, and to everyone's surprise, Bobby Bobolink wins. Old Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay are forced to admit that they were wrong about Bobby Bobolink, and the three cousins reconcile.
