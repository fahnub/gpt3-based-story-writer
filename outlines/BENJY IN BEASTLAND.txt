Benjy is a very naughty, disagreeable boy. He is always dirty and he hates animals. One day, he plays a cruel trick on Nox, the family dog, by pricking his lips with a needle. Nox is hurt and the little sisters are very upset.

Later, Benjy and another boy kill a small dog and throw him in the river. That night, Benjy has a dream that he goes to Beastland, where he is put on trial for his crimes. The animals all want to punish him, but the Lion decides to send him back to Earth.

When he wakes up, he is in the river and Nox has saved him. Nox takes him back to the willow tree and Benjy's papa finds him. He is very sick for a long time, but during his illness he learns to be kinder and more gentle.

One day, Mr. Rough, the other family dog, comes to see Benjy and he is so excited that he dies of joy. This experience makes Benjy realize how much he has hurt animals in the past and he vows to never be unkind to them again.
