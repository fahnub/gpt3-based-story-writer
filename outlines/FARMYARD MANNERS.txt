Turkey Proudfoot asks Simon Screecher, a bird, to deliver a message to his cousin Solomon Owl to meet him in the woods tomorrow night. Simon agrees and flies off. A short while later, Turkey hears Solomon laughing and assumes he is laughing at the message. When Simon returns, Turkey demands to know what the joke is. Simon explains that Solomon thinks Turkey is a tough old bird and doesn't want to bother with him. Turkey gets angry and tells Simon to go away. Simon starts to leave, but Turkey stops him and tells him to stay awhile longer. They both become sleepy and soon realize it is dawn. Turkey hurries home to the farmyard to get breakfast.
