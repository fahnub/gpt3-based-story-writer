Johnnie Green's father tells him that owning a cow is a big responsibility, and Johnnie soon learns that this means he has to do things like milk her, even if he'd rather be doing something else. The Muley Cow is always escaping to the back pasture, and Johnnie has to chase her down each time. He eventually turns this into a game, pretending to hunt her like a buffalo, but the Muley Cow is not amused. One day, she gets revenge by holding back her milk when Johnnie tries to milk her.
