The mighty baron, Batteroff, raises a whale in a watering trough. When the whale grows large and fat, he eats the baron's brindle cat. But the cat, once inside the whale, begins to tickle with her tail. This the monster could not stand, and he spewed her out onto dry land. That night, when all was fine as silk, the cat told the baron how she got the whale to cough.
