In the story, Dickie Deer Mouse and Fatty Coon are foraging for food in the woods. At this time of year, the deer shed their horns, which the Deer Mouse family feast on. However, Fatty Coon is not aware that the season for finding horns is over, and he sets out to find some.

 Dickie Deer Mouse knows that if Fatty Coon keeps searching for horns, he will stay away from the cornfield - and away from old dog Spot, who Dickie warned him about. Sure enough, when dawn breaks, Fatty Coon is back, angry and empty-handed.

 Dickie tries to reason with Fatty, telling him that he should just eat all the corn he can while he has the chance. But Fatty is determined to go to the cornfield, and Dickie ends up going with him.

As they enter the cornfield, they are met by old Mr. Crow, who tells them they are in a dangerous place. Dickie Deer Mouse is polite and says that there should be enough corn for everyone, but Fatty Coon just stuffs his face full of the food.
