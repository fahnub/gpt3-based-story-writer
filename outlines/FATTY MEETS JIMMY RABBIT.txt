Fatty Coon is strolling through the woods when he meets Jimmy Rabbit. Jimmy asks Fatty if he's hungry, and Fatty says he's just eaten the best meal of his life and is not hungry. Jimmy invites Fatty to come play barber-shop with him and his brother, and Fatty agrees.

At the barber-shop, Fatty is asked to be the barber's pole. He sticks his tail out of a hole in the tree and is proud of his beautiful tail. The barber, Jimmy Rabbit, asks Fatty how much he wants to charge for a hair-cut. Fatty asks to be paid in cabbage leaves, and Jimmy agrees.

Jimmy begins to cut Fatty's hair, and Fatty is pleased with the results. However, when Jimmy is finished, Fatty's moustache is also gone. Fatty is upset and goes home.

His mother is shocked at his appearance and scolds him. Fatty is embarrassed and ashamed. The next day, he can't find Jimmy Rabbit anywhere. He hears hoots and jeers from the other forest-people and feels silly. He wishes he could find Jimmy Rabbit and get even with him.
