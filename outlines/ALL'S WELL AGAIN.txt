Rusty Wren is a small bird who is very happy to have found a bunch of tobacco leaves in the carriage house on the farm. He goes home to get his wife so she can see it too, but she is uninterested. She shows him an egg in their nest and he is very happy, singing to her. They never mention the tobacco again.
