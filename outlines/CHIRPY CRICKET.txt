Buster Bumblebee is not a fan of the early morning trumpeting that wakes up the workers in his home. He talks to his friends about the situation and Cricket suggests he talk to the trumpeter in a friendly manner to try and get her to change her ways. Buster is nervous but goes through with it and the trumpeter agrees to trumpet more softly in the morning.
