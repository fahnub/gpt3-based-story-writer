Kiddie Katydid is a talented young fiddler who lives in Pleasant Valley. When news of his talent gets out, Mr. Frog, the local tailor, becomes angry that he wasn't the one to discover Kiddie's gift.

Mr. Frog finds out that Mr. Crow, the local bird, has put together a committee to invite Kiddie to join the Pleasant Valley orchestra. This is the last straw for Mr. Frog, who was hoping to get credit for discovering Kiddie's talent.

Mr. Frog comes up with a plan to get revenge on Mr. Crow and the other members of the committee. He makes a small coat out of green cloth and hides near his shop, where he knows the committee will be coming to call on Kiddie.

When the committee arrives, they are surprised to see Kiddie walking towards them, wearing the coat Mr. Frog made for him. Kiddie is cold, but the coat keeps him warm.

The members of the committee are so impressed with Kiddie's coat that they all want one for themselves. Mr. Frog comes out of hiding and tells them that he can make them all coats, but they will have to wait until he opens his shop again.

The members of the committee are forced to wait in the cold for Mr. Frog to open his shop. When he finally does, they are all so happy to have their new coats that they forget all about Kiddie Katydid and invite Mr. Frog to join the orchestra instead.
