Jasper Jay is left alone in the woods with Mr. Crow's umbrella and has a great time playing with it. He eventually opens it up, despite promising not to, and enjoys the rain that comes. Mr. Crow, meanwhile, is at a crows' meeting which breaks up when it begins to rain. He hurries back to the woods to find Jasper Jay, and is angry to see him with the umbrella open, enjoying the rain. Jasper Jay pretends to be surprised and laughs at his cousin.
