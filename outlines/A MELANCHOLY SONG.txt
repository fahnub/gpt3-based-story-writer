A young girl is sent by her mother to fetch some barm (yeast) from the bakery. She is warned to be careful of the young men who may try to harm her. However, when she gets there, the young men tease her and end up breaking her pitcher and spilling the water. They also scold her mother and kiss her sister. The young girl is very upset by this and runs home to her mother.
