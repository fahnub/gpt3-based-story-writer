Johnnie Green is trying to teach his lamb, Snowball, how to jump through hoops so they can join the circus. He starts by using a bare hoop, and when Snowball does well, he rewards him with some cracked corn. They continue practicing and Johnnie is able to get Snowball to jump through one of the paper hoops he had made the day before.

Farmer Green catches Johnnie giving Snowball the cracked corn and scolds him, but Johnnie is able to convince him that they're just trying to keep Snowball thin so he can jump better. In the end, Farmer Green agrees to let Johnnie continue giving Snowball the occasional treat of cracked corn.
