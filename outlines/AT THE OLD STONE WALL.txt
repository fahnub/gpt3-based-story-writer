Mr. Chippy is a small bird who lives in a wild grapevine near an old stone wall. One day, he is alarmed by a long, slim shape that darting from a chink in the wall. His neighbors begin to echo his warning notes, but young Master Robin scoffs at the idea that he could be in danger. Mr. Chippy's wife is away from home, so he continues to fly back and forth in a flutter.

Finally, Rusty Wren's wife gives a piercing scream, warning that Master Robin will be caught. Master Robin is indignant at being called fat and turns around to confront the speaker, only to find a snake right behind him!
