The Story Girl came up with the idea to have everyone in their group write down their dreams in an exercise book, to see who could have the most interesting collection. They began writing down their dreams, but quickly realized that they were all having the same dream. In the dream, they were in a dark forest, being chased by a Giant. They would all wake up just before the Giant caught them. This continued for several nights until they realized that the Giant was actually Uncle Roger. They confronted him and he admitted that he had been purposely giving them all the same dream in order to scare them.
