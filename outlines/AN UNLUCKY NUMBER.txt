Mr. Crow goes to Mr. Frog's tailor shop to get a coat made for winter. Mr. Frog sews a coat for him with thirteen spots on it, and Mr. Crow is angry, saying he wanted a plain coat. Mr. Frog tells him there are four openings in the coat through which he can easily slip out, but Mr. Crow doesn't believe him. Mr. Frog then opens the back seam of the coat and Mr. Crow is able to take it off. He tells Mr. Frog that thirteen is an unlucky number and leaves the shop.
