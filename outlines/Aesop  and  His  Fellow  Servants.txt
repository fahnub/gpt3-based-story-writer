A merchant is preparing for a journey and assigns his servants various tasks and burdens to carry. Aesop, the slave of the merchant, is given the task of carrying the bread basket, which is the heaviest burden.

Aesop struggles to carry the basket but perseveres. When it is time to distribute the food, Aesop does so equally among all the servants, lightening his own load in the process.

For the rest of the journey, Aesop only has to carry an empty basket, while the other servants struggle under the weight of their heavier loads. The other servants eventually come to admire Aesop's ingenuity in managing his burden.
