Grunty Pig insists that his tail is the most beautiful in the neighborhood, but old dog Spot points out that it would be more convenient if it were nailed to the outside of the barn. Grunty Pig is reluctant to part with his tail, but Spot persuades him to see how tailless pigs look. Grunty Pig squeezes through a hole in the fence to follow Spot, but gets stuck. Spot nips him and he falls through to the other side. Spot leads him to a group of tailless pigs and Grunty Pig is horrified. He runs back home and Farmer Green cuts off his tail and nails it to the barn.
