It's wintertime and Cuffy Bear and his sister Silkie are excited to play in the snow. They have a blast playing tag and hide-and-seek and somersaults, and they also eat a lot of chestnuts. Cuffy Bear, being the greediest, eats the most and soon gets a pain in his stomach.

Mrs. Bear scolds him and tells him to pick up all the chestnut shells on the floor. Cuffy and Silkie start yawning and before long, they both fall asleep. Mrs. Bear smiles and takes them to their bedchamber, covering them with leaves so they'll be warm. That night, Mrs. Bear and Mr. Bear go to bed early too.

The next day, no one in the family wakes up. They all just sleep and sleep throughout the entire winter.
