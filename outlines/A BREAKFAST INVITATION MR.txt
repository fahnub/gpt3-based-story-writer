Benny Badger is a digging machine and he is not afraid of hard work. So when a deer mouse comments on how many holes Benny has dug, Benny is not offended. Instead, he invites the deer mouse to come see his newest and most impressive den. The deer mouse is hesitant, but Benny is persistent and finally convinces the deer mouse to come inside.

What the deer mouse doesn't know is that Benny is planning to eat him for breakfast! The deer mouse is a plump little guy and Benny is feeling hungry. But the deer mouse is not stupid and he quickly realizes what Benny's intentions are. He makes up an excuse about being hungry himself and needing to get breakfast, but Benny is not fooled.

The deer mouse makes a break for it and barely escapes being eaten. He runs back to his mouse friends and tells them all about Benny Badger and his diabolical plan. The mice are terrified and they all decide to move to a new location where Benny Badger cannot find them.

And that is how Benny Badger became known as the most dangerous creature in the forest.
