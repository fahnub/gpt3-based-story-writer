In this playful rhyme, children are encouraged to come out and play under the light of the moon. They are urged to leave their supper and sleep behind, and to come with their friends into the street. With a half-penny roll to share between them, the children set off to find milk and flour to make a pudding. In half an hour, they'll be able to enjoy their sweet treat and the fun of the night.
