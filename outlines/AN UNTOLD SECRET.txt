Billy Woodchuck is excited to hear that Jimmy Rabbit is throwing a party and sets out to find him to ask a question. He runs into Nimble Deer who tells him that he is also invited to the party and is going to help Jimmy with something. Billy is worried that he will be stepped on at the party since Nimble's hooves are sharp, but Nimble reassures him that he is only helping Jimmy and there will be no fighting. The next time Billy sees Jimmy, he asks him what he is going to do to help with the party. Jimmy tells him that he is going to use his horns, but won't say anything else.
