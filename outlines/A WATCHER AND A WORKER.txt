Benny Badger is searching for a ground squirrel hole to dig when he finds one that is recent. He debates on whether or not to tell Mr. Coyote, his helper, and decides against it. Mr. Coyote, sly as he is, has been following Benny and calls out to him. They both know that the owner of the hole, the ground squirrel, is home. Benny offers to let Mr. Coyote dig while he watches, but Mr. Coyote insists that Benny should do the digging because he is better at it than Mr. Coyote. Benny agrees and starts to dig when Mr. Coyote moves a few steps away and says he will watch from the back door. Benny digs for a while, stopping every few minutes to listen for Mr. Coyote, but all he hears is a chuckle. Mr. Coyote is watching Benny dig while Benny tries to listen and dig at the same time.
