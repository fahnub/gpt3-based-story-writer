Frisky Squirrel and Uncle Sammy Coon go to Farmer Green's place to steal corn. Frisky climbs into the corn-house through a hole in the wall and begins dropping corn out for Uncle Sammy to pick up. After a while, Frisky peeks out of the hole to see what's taking Uncle Sammy so long, and is surprised to see that he has run away with the bag of corn. Frisky narrowly escapes getting caught by Farmer Green, and decides not to tell his mother about the incident. The next day, he runs into Uncle Sammy again and confronts him about the stolen corn. Uncle Sammy denies taking it, but Frisky doesn't believe him.
