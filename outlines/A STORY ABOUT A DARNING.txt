The story is about a darning-needle who believes she is an embroidery-needle and is very proud. She is being used by the fingers to sew a shoe upper leather and is not happy with the common work. She breaks and is then stuck in the front of the cook's dress with sealing-wax. She is now a breast-pin and is very proud of herself. She talks to a bit of bottle-glass and they both think they are very costly. The bit of bottle-glass is washed away and the darning-needle is left. Two boys find her and stick her in an egg-shell. A wagon-wheel goes over her but she does not break.
