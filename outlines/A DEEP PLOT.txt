As time goes on, Betsy Butterfly grows increasingly fond of Joseph Bumble, despite the fact that she never sees him with his cousin Buster Bumblebee. Finally, she asks him why they never seem to hang out together, and Joseph explains that they have different interests and that he would much rather spend time with her than with Buster.

Betsy's other admirers become jealous of the time she spends with Joseph and hatch a plan to find out more about him. They ask Daddy Longlegs to invite Buster to a party in the meadow, thinking that Joseph will also show up. Joseph does indeed come to the party, but Buster is nowhere to be found. It quickly becomes apparent that Joseph has been lying about his relationship to Buster, and the other animals kick him out of the meadow.
