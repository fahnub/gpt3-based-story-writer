Eliza and her son are travelling north to Canada to escape slavery. Along the way, they are helped by kind people, including a group of Quakers. The Quakers are gentle, quiet people who dress alike in plain grey clothes. They are opposed to slavery and often help slaves who have escaped from their masters.

The Quakers are fond of Eliza and would like her to stay with them, but she is determined to keep going. She is afraid that her slave owner will find her and take her back.

That night, Eliza's husband George arrives. He has escaped from slavery and has come to find his wife and son. Eliza is overjoyed to see him and they spend the night together. The next morning, they continue their journey to Canada.
