Amelia is a young girl who is grieving over a torn muslin frock. A kind spider overhears her lamenting and offers some sage advice: that if Amelia had used her tears and sighs to sew up the frock, it would be mended by now.

The spider's words inspire Amelia to be more productive with her time and to see the value in hard work. She goes on to have a productive day, mending her frock and learning a valuable lesson in the process.
