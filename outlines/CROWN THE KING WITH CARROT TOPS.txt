A king is crowned with carrot tops, dressed in sateen, and given lots of licorice drops and suckers. He is a powerful and fierce king who kills pirates and washes in their tears. He rides a dashing, dappled gray charger and has ginger pop and lemon pie for breakfast every day. A royal canopy and whiskers for the king and tresses for the queen are provided.
