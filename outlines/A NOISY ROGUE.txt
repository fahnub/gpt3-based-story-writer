Jasper Jay is a noisy, rowdy bird who loves to tease the cat and eat bugs and fruit. In the winter, he loves to eat nuts. He is especially skilled at cracking open tough nuts. Jasper is also a hoarder, and he likes to hide away nuts in different places so he can have a stash for the winter. However, he often forgets where he hides them and they end up growing into trees. Jasper is a rogue, but he is also helpful to Farmer Green in many ways.
