Elidyr is a young boy who attends a school run by monks in Wales. He is a poor scholar and is constantly in trouble for playing truant and not paying attention in class. One day, he runs away from school and into the country. He finds a cave to sleep in for the night and in the morning, sets off again. He is soon found by two elves who take him back to their home in Fairyland.

Elidyr spends some time in Fairyland and enjoys playing with the other elves. However, he eventually gets homesick and asks the King of Fairyland for permission to visit his mother. The King agrees and Elidyr returns to his mother's cottage. He visits her often, always making sure to return to Fairyland before anyone sees him.

One day, Elidyr's mother asks him to bring her back a ball from Fairyland. He agrees and takes one of the balls back with him. However, he is caught by the elves and they take the ball back. Elidyr is upset because he has broken his word and decides to go back to Fairyland to confess his mistake to the King. However, he is unable to find the entrance to Fairyland and so returns to the monastery. He eventually becomes a famous scholar.
