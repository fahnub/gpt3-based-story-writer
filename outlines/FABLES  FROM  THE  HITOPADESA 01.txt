The Camel and the Pig are having a discussion about which is better, being tall or being short. The Camel argues that being tall is better, while the Pig argues that being short is better. They agree to put their respective points to the test and see who is right.

First, they come to a garden enclosed by a low wall. The Camel easily reaches over the wall and eats his fill of the plants inside. He then jeers at the Pig, who was unable to enter the garden and get any food. The Camel argues that this proves that being tall is better.

Next, they come to a second garden, this one enclosed by a high wall with a gate. The Pig is able to enter through the gate and eat his fill, while the Camel is once again left outside. The Pig argues that this proves that being short is better.

Finally, they both agree that each has their own advantages and that there is no clear winner in the debate. The Camel keeps his hump and the Pig keeps his snout, and they both go their separate ways.
