Aunt Polly Woodchuck is a famous doctor who is called to Mrs. Rabbit's house to treat Jimmy for mumps. However, when Aunt Polly arrives, she discovers that it is not Jimmy who is sick, but the hot-water bottle that is full of holes. Aunt Polly shows Mrs. Rabbit how to prevent the new hot-water bottle from getting full of holes and then hangs the old one around Jimmy's neck. Jimmy is uncomfortable with the hot-water bottle around his neck, but is glad that Aunt Polly has not told his mother what he did.
