Outline: Benny Badger is searching for a ground squirrel hole to dig when he finds one that is recent. He debates on whether or not to tell Mr. Coyote, his helper, and decides against it. Mr. Coyote, sly as he is, has been following Benny and calls out to him. They both know that the owner of the hole, the ground squirrel, is home. Benny offers to let Mr. Coyote dig while he watches, but Mr. Coyote insists that Benny should do the digging because he is better at it than Mr. Coyote. Benny agrees and starts to dig when Mr. Coyote moves a few steps away and says he will watch from the back door. Benny digs for a while, stopping every few minutes to listen for Mr. Coyote, but all he hears is a chuckle. Mr. Coyote is watching Benny dig while Benny tries to listen and dig at the same time.

Story so far:  Benny Badger is trying to catch a ground squirrel, but Mr. Coyote is following him. When Mr. Coyote suggests that the owner of the hole might be home, Benny generously offers to let Mr. Coyote dig for a while. Mr. Coyote turns down Benny Badger's offer to help dig a tunnel, saying that he would be disappointed not to do it himself. He explains that he is a better digger than Badger, and that he will go around to the back door and watch while Badger digs. Benny is waiting to hear Mr. Coyote's call, but all he hears is a chuckle. He's getting frustrated, but he doesn't want to make Mr. Coyote mad by saying anything.

Last chunk: listen; for he did not want to miss hearing Mr. Coyote's call.  But his ears caught nothing more than a chuckle from the spot where Mr.Coyote sat on his haunches in the grass, watching.  [Illustration: Mr. Owl greets Benny very coldly.]  "I can stand his chuckling--if only he won't sing!" Benny said tohimself.
