Outline: Dorothy and her friends are sitting in the throne room of the royal palace in the Emerald City, awaiting the arrival of the invited guests for Ozma's birthday celebration. The first to arrive are the gingerbread man, King Dough the First, and his head booleywag (a child-like creature), Chick the Cherub, followed by a rubber bear. They are all from the Kingdoms of Hiland and Loland and Dorothy introduces them to the others.

Next to arrive is a tall, beautiful woman clad in an exquisite trailing gown - the Sorceress known as Glinda the Good. She is warmly welcomed by all and escorted to her room by fifty servants.

Then comes Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T.E., head professor at the Royal College of Oz, who wishes to read an Ode he has composed in honor of Ozma's birthday; but the Scarecrow won't let him.

Last chunk: music; so  they all went out upon the balcony.  This was at the front of the  palace and overlooked the streets of the City, being higher than the  wall that shut in the palace grounds.  They saw approaching down the  street a band of musicians, playing as hard and loud as they could,  while the people of the Emerald City crowded the sidewalks and cheered  so lustily that they almost drowned the noise of the drums and horns.  Dorothy looked to see what they were cheering at, and discovered that
