Outline: Turkey Proudfoot is in the farmyard when he hears a strange gobbling noise. He is worried that he made the noise himself, but the rooster assures him that he did not. The gobbling noise happens again, and Turkey Proudfoot is convinced that there is another turkey around.

He goes to the farmhouse to investigate and finds a green bird in a cage who is making the noise. The bird introduces itself as Polly and Turkey Proudfoot is not impressed. He tries to attack the bird, but ends up getting scolded by the hired man.

Turkey Proudfoot sulks behind the barn, muttering about the bird. He is angry that the bird is called Pretty Polly when he thinks it should be called Turkey Bird.

Story so far:  Turkey Proudfoot is upset because he thinks the bird that imitates him should be called a Turkey Bird, but instead it's called Pretty Polly.

Last chunk: Turkey Proudfoot ran off and hid behind the barn and sulked.  "There's a bird around here," he muttered, "that mocks Miss Kitty Cat;  and they call him a Cat Bird. Now, here's a bird that mocks me; so I  should think they'd call him a Turkey Bird. But they don't. I heard the  hired man call him Pretty Polly.  "Pretty Polly indeed!" Turkey Proudfoot sniffed. "That creature is  nothing but a bunch of green feathers and a loud voice."
