Outline: Cuffy Bear finds a bucket of water hanging from a tree and discovers that it is the sweetest water he's ever tasted. He decides to leave the bucket so that he can come back and drink more the next day.

Story so far:  Cuffy finds a shiny new tin bucket fastened to a tree and decides he must have it to play with. This passage tells the story of a bear named Cuffy who gets his paws pricked by a porcupine. He is a good little bear and doesn't hit his sister Silkie, even though he knows it would hurt his paws. He loves feeling the sunshine on his black coat. Cuffy is delighted to have found a spring of delicious, sweet water, and decides to drink as much as he can before returning the next day. Cuffy finds a bucket of water inside a tree and is surprised to find that it tastes sweet. Cuffy is happy to be able to walk again after his paws healed. He strays down the mountain, further from home than he intended. Cuffy sees a small spout from which drops of water fall into a bucket. He wonders where the water comes from and concludes that there must be a spring.

Last chunk: rolling it about on the ground. And he was just  going to knock it off the hook that held it when he noticed that a small  spout had been driven into the tree just above the bucket. And as Cuffy  stood there on his hind legs, reaching up as high as he could, he saw a  tiny drop fall from the spout and go splash! into the bucket. Then, as  he watched, another drop fell; and another and another and another.  Cuffy wondered where they came from. It must be--he thought--that there  was a spring
