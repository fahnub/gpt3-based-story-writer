Outline: The story follows a group of sheep who get mixed up and start going in different directions. Snowball Lamb ends up face-to-face with Aunt Nancy Ewe, who is so big he can't budge her. Aunt Nancy gets scared when she hears there is a bear around, and she ends up sweeping Snowball off the wall with her. Snowball falls into the raspberry bushes and thinks for sure the bear is going to eat him. However, the bear ends up being scared off by the other sheep and Snowball is left unharmed. Aunt Nancy is not pleased with Snowball when she sees him again and she scolds him for getting them all into a mix-up.

Snowball is lying on the ground with his eyes closed, thinking about the bear that is about to eat him. He feels a pain in his tail and realizes that the bear has already started to eat him. He opens his eyes and sees that his tail is still in the bear's mouth.

The bear has begun to eat me!" Snowball thought.  As for the bear, he didn't say a single word. And that seemed odd.
