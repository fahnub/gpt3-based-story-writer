Outline: Fatty Coon is strolling through the woods when he meets Jimmy Rabbit. Jimmy asks Fatty if he's hungry, and Fatty says he's just eaten the best meal of his life and is not hungry. Jimmy invites Fatty to come play barber-shop with him and his brother, and Fatty agrees.

At the barber-shop, Fatty is asked to be the barber's pole. He sticks his tail out of a hole in the tree and is proud of his beautiful tail. The barber, Jimmy Rabbit, asks Fatty how much he wants to charge for a hair-cut. Fatty asks to be paid in cabbage leaves, and Jimmy agrees.

Jimmy begins to cut Fatty's hair, and Fatty is pleased with the results. However, when Jimmy is finished, Fatty's moustache is also gone. Fatty is upset and goes home.

His mother is shocked at his appearance and scolds him. Fatty is embarrassed and ashamed. The next day, he can't find Jimmy Rabbit anywhere. He hears hoots and jeers from the other forest-people and feels silly. He wishes he could find Jimmy Rabbit and get even with him.

Story so far:  Jimmy Rabbit trims Fatty Coon's fur and moustache, making him look funny. Fatty feels uneasy when he sees his moustache on the floor. Fatty Coon feels foolish after getting his head shaved by Jimmy Rabbit, but he makes up his mind to get even with him. The next day, however, he can't find Jimmy Rabbit or his brother. Jimmy Rabbit and his brother offer to cut Fatty Coon's hair for free in exchange for using his tail as a barber's pole. Fatty Coon agrees and insists that Jimmy start cutting his hair immediately.

Last chunk: already stuck it out through the hole; and he had half a mind to pull it  in again.  Jimmy Rabbit and his brother whispered together for a few moments.  "I'll tell you what we'll do," Jimmy said. "If you'll let us use your  tail for the barber's pole, we'll cut your hair free. Isn't that fair  enough?"  Fatty Coon was satisfied. But he insisted that Jimmy begin to cut his  hair at once.  "I'm doing my part of the work now," he pointed out. "So there's no  reason why you shouldn't do yours."
