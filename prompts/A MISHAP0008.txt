Outline: Johnnie Green is a young boy who loves to collect butterflies. However, he can only hunt for them when the weather is good. When a three-day rain comes, Johnnie becomes bored and wishes he had started a different kind of collection.

The weather clears at last and Johnnie hurriedly takes his dog, Spot, and his butterfly net to the flower garden. He soon spots a beautiful butterfly, Betsy, and starts to chase her. Betsy is not afraid of Johnnie and even allows him to get close to her.

 Johnnie Green tries to capture Betsy in his net, but he trips and falls. This gives Betsy the chance to escape. Johnnie's dog, Spot, also tries to run away from the scene and ends up getting his head stuck in the butterfly net. Spot runs all the way to the woods before he is able to free himself.

Johnnie is sad that he lost Betsy and has to start his collection all over again.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green shouts after his dog Spot, who has run into the woods with a net over his head. Johnnie runs after him but soon turns back, realizing Spot is likely to freed himself in the woods. The passage tells the story of a boy who starts a butterfly collection, but gets discouraged when it rains for three days. However, the sun comes out eventually, and he is able to continue his collection. Old Spot is scared of the flower garden and hopes no one noticed. He won't go near it for a week.

Last chunk: to be twice as spry as hehad shown himself, if he expected to capture her.  Old Spot didn't come home till afternoon. When he appeared at last helooked very sheepish. He hoped no one had noticed his fright. And hewouldn't go near the flower garden again for a whole week.
