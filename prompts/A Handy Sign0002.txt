Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is always being hunted by predators, so he decides to build a little hut near the fence between the meadow and the pasture. He hangs a sign outside his door that says "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow" on one side and "At Home. Don't Knock. Walk In" on the other.

One day, Tommy Fox sneaks up to Master Meadow Mouse's hut and sees the sign that says "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow." He decides to wait around and come back the next day.

The next day, Tommy Fox comes back and sees the sign that says "At Home. Don't Knock. Walk In." He sticks his nose through the doorway, but Master Meadow Mouse is nowhere to be found. Tommy Fox has been tricked by the clever Meadow Mouse and is very embarrassed.

Story so far:  The passage describes a creature that is annoyed at being tricked by a meadow mouse. It hopes that nobody ever finds out about the incident. Master Meadow Mouse lives in a good home, but it is not as safe as his old nest. To protect himself, he hangs a sign on his door that says "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow." Master Meadow Mouse hangs a sign on his door that says 'At Home. Don't Knock. Walk In.' and goes back inside to take a nap. Tommy Fox sees the sign and goes to eat Master Meadow Mouse, but Master Meadow Mouse is already gone to lunch. Tommy Fox is looking for Master Meadow Mouse, but can't find him. He does find his mouse house, but sees a sign that says he is away. Tommy looks for him, but can't find him anywhere. Tommy Fox tries to catch Meadow Mouse, but Meadow Mouse is smart and always one step ahead. Master Meadow Mouse spends a lot of time hunting for food and taking naps. He used to live in Farmer Green's woodpile, but moved away before winter. Master Meadow Mouse makes a home for himself near a fence between the meadow and the pasture, finding shelter from predators. His home keeps out the cold and rain.

Last chunk: had finished building his nest there, Master Meadow Mouse  settled near the fence between the meadow and the pasture. The mowing  machine hadn't cut the weeds and grass that grew close to the fence. He  found shelter there from the sharp eyes of birds that would have caught  him had they been able to.  This time Master Meadow Mouse didn't live underground. He made a sort of  little hut for himself, which kept out the cold in chilly weather, and  shed the rain when it didn't pour down too hard.
