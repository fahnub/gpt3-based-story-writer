Outline: The flock of sheep are running away from a bear, with Snowball leading the way. They jump over a stone wall into a tangle of berry bushes, where Snowball is confronted by the bear. He runs back over the wall to safety, with the rest of the flock following close behind.

Story so far:  Aunt Nancy is scolding Snowball for disturbing Uncle Jerry Chuck's rest with their recent wild scramble. Snowball is trying to escape the sheep, and the foremost of the oncoming flock of sheep sees him. The passage describes a sheep who starts running after seeing a bear, with the rest of the flock following behind. The sheep realizes there is no bear, but by that point the other sheep are too far behind to stop. Snowball promises not to go near Uncle Jerry's house again, but Aunt Nancy tells him to pretend that there is a bear beyond the stone wall instead. Snowball was walking along when he suddenly remembered what a woman had said to him about there being a bear in the area. He then saw the bear and ran into a tangle of berry bushes to hide.

Last chunk: rest. And then Snowball remembered what  she had said to him. If a bear--instead of Uncle Jerry Chuck--lived in  the hole at the foot of the ledge!  Well, that thought was enough to make Snowball swerve sharply to his  right. And a few moments later he bobbed over the wall a little further  up the hillside.  Just beyond the wall grew a tangle of berry bushes. And into the midst  of them Snowball jumped. And out of the midst of them, right in front of  him, there rose up on his hind legs--a bear!
