Outline: Brownie Beaver lives in a village of beavers that is built in a pond. The houses in the village are all built under water, with doors that lead into a winding hall that goes up into the house. Brownie Beaver's forefathers built the village in this way because they thought it would be safer from enemies. The village has a dam that is used to keep the pond full. The dam is very old and is never finished because the villagers keep making it wider. Brownie Beaver is a young beaver who works on the dam sometimes. The beavers in the village cut down trees and save the bark and branches to eat during winter. Some of the food is stored in the houses and some is fastened under water near the dam. Brownie Beaver thinks his way of living is normal, even though it may seem strange to others.

Story so far:  Farmer Green owns a village near one end of Pleasant Valley, but he seldom visits it because it is a long distance from his house. The villagers there think they can stay as long as they want without being disturbed. Brownie Beaver's great-great-grandfather helped build a dam that was never finished. The villagers kept making it wider, and it had to be kept in repair because bits of it would sometimes wash away.

Last chunk: yearsbefore, when his great-great-grandfather had helped throw the damacross the stream.  The dam was there still. It was so old that trees were growing on it.And there was an odd thing about it: it was never finished. ThoughBrownie Beaver was a young chap, he worked on the dam sometimes, likeall his neighbors. You see, the villagers kept making the dam wider.And since it was built of sticks and mud, the water sometimes washedbits of it away: so it had to be kept in repair.  If Brownie Beaver
