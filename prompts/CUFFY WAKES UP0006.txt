Outline: Mr. and Mrs. Bear and their children, Cuffy and Silkie, live in a cave high up on Blue Mountain. Every winter, they hibernate, sleeping for weeks or months at a time. On the first day of spring, Mr. Bear wakes up and realizes he's very hungry. He goes outside to look for food, and Mrs. Bear wakes up the children, telling them to go outside and play.

Cuffy and Silkie play happily together for a while, but eventually Cuffy loses his temper and hits Silkie. His parents scold him, and he promises to try to be better.

The bears spend the rest of the spring and summer playing, fishing, and gathering food to store up for the next winter. When autumn comes, they say goodbye to the animals who will be hibernating and go back into their cave to sleep.

Once again, winter comes and goes, and spring arrives. Mr. Bear wakes up and goes outside, only to find that Cuffy has been bad again - he's hit Silkie and made her cry. His parents scold him, but he still can't seem to help himself.

The cycle continues year after year, with Cuffy never managing to control his temper despite his good intentions.
