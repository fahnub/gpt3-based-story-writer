Outline: Daddy Longlegs is delighted to be home again and his neighbors remark that they have never seen him so happy and cheerful. One reason for Daddy's good spirits is the fact that the wind no longer blows and he can venture abroad without being buffeted about.

 Daddy Longlegs is so relieved by the change in the weather that it seems to him there could be no danger anywhere and he begins to feel quite important. His friends rush to the stone wall to talk with him and he begins to boast about his wild ride in Farmer Green's wagon.

At first, Daddy's friends enjoy hearing about his adventure, but he boasts so much about his bravery that his listeners soon grow tired of hearing him talk. And instead of his having many callers, it is not long before Daddy Longlegs finds that nobody comes near him, even to say howdy-do.

Feeling that he is in danger of choking over the babble that surges up from within him, Daddy Longlegs decides to go and call on Rusty Wren, who lives in the cherry tree near Farmer Green's bedroom window.

Rusty is perched on the tin roof of his house when Daddy Longlegs arrives and the first thing that Daddy Longlegs says to him is this: "Is your wife at home?" Rusty says "No!" in such a cheerful tone that Daddy Longlegs knows they can have a good chat without being disturbed.

Story so far:  Daddy Longlegs talks about his "wild ride" to everyone, bragging and trying to seem brave. His friends enjoy hearing about it at first, but eventually they get tired of his bragging. Daddy Longlegs is surprised to learn that an army is coming to capture him, and even more surprised when he has a real adventure before the day is over. Daddy Longlegs boasted about his bravery, but soon nobody wanted to hear him talk. Feeling lonely and in danger of choking on his words, he decided to set out on an adventure. Daddy Longlegs goes to visit Rusty Wren, hoping to hear about Rusty's cousin's party. Daddy Longlegs finds Rusty Wren on the roof of his house and asks him if his wife is home. Rusty says no in a cheerful tone, indicating that they can have a good chat without being disturbed.

Last chunk: everybody knew that she was a person  of uncertain temper.  But Daddy found Rusty perched on the tin roof of his house (his house  was made of a maple-syrup can). And the first thing that Daddy Longlegs  said to him was this: "Is your wife at home?"  That may seem a strange question. But Rusty Wren appeared to know what  his caller meant. Anyhow, Rusty said, "No!" in such a cheerful tone that  Daddy Longlegs knew they could have a good chat without being  disturbed.
