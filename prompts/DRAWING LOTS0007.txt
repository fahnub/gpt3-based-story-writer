Outline: Buster Bumblebee's mother tells her forty-nine honey-makers that Freddie Firefly and at least forty-eight of his relations are expected at the Bumblebees' house at dusk. Each Firefly will provide a light for the honey-makers to use while they work in the clover field at night. The honey-makers are angry about having to work half the night, and one of them tries to escape when they are told they will have to draw lots to see who goes with Freddie. The one who tries to escape is the one who is chosen, and she is the worst-tempered of the bunch. Freddie begins to wish he had gone to the dance at the swamp.

Story so far:  The honey-makers are unhappy with the recent announcement and blame Buster for it. The Queen Bumblebee tells her forty-nine honey-makers that Freddie Firefly and his forty-eight relatives are coming over at dusk, and each Firefly will provide a light for the bees to work by in the clover field. After midnight, they can sleep until dawn. Freddie Firefly offers to take one of the Queen's workers to the clover-patch to help with the light, as he is unable to provide enough light himself. Queen Bumblebee is waiting for Freddie Firefly to arrive with the rest of his family. The honey-makers are angry and not sleepy, and the Queen is glad. Freddie Firefly is gathering clover nectar with a surly bumblebee.

Last chunk: field with Freddie Firefly and gather clover nectar until midnight.  Unluckily for Freddie, she was the worst-tempered person in the whole  Bumblebee household. And when she saw that she alone of the whole family  was going to lose half her night's sleep you may be sure she felt very  surly.  Freddie noticed a wicked gleam in her eyes. And he began to wish he had  gone to the dance over near the swamp.
