Outline: Frisky Squirrel is visiting Farmer Green's place and is looking for some beechnuts. He finds some beechnut shucks near the woodshed door and begins to nibble on them. Miss Kitty Cat, who is inside the woodshed, smells the squirrel and begins to stalk him. Frisky Squirrel smells the cat and tries to escape, but the cat catches him.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow tells Frisky the Squirrel to turn back because there is a cat at the farmhouse. A squirrel smells a beechnut and falls over when he sees a cat in the doorway. Frisky the cat is hoping to find some food in the farmyard, but all the corn has been eaten by Henrietta Hen. He then smells beechnuts and heads towards the woodshed.

Last chunk: to himself. "If the  cat gets hurt it will be her own fault, for I certainly won't harm her."  When Frisky reached the farmyard he crept around a corner of the barn,  hoping to find a few kernels of corn. But Henrietta Hen had been there  before him and there wasn't one kernel left. He ran here and there about  the yard. And at last, when quite near the woodshed door, he sat up  suddenly, twitched his nose a few times, and said, "Ha! I smell  beechnuts!"  Now, that was not strange. Johnnie Green
