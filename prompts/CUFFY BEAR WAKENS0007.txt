Outline: Nimble, a deer, is out foraging for food when he happens upon the cave where he had waited for Cuffy Bear weeks before. He remembers how he had fed upon the green things under the snow and begins to paw away the snow to find more food.

Cuffy Bear, who had been inside the cave sleeping, wakes up and comes out to find Nimble. At first, Cuffy doesn't recognize Nimble because he has shed his horns since they last met. But once Cuffy realizes who Nimble is, he is surprised to see him because he had assumed Nimble would have left long ago.

Nimble tells Cuffy that he only stayed because he heard old dog Spot coming. Cuffy is relieved to hear this and the two animals go their separate ways.

Story so far:  Cuffy Bear and Nimble meet again after a long time apart. Cuffy Bear is surprised to see how much Nimble has changed, and Nimble points out that Cuffy Bear has changed too - he looks much hungrier. They decide to walk down the mountain together. Nimble, a deer, remembers the time he met Cuffy Bear and how he fed him green things. He thinks about this as he roams around the valley and up the side of the mountain. Nimble tells Cuffy Bear that he did not wait for him, but Cuffy Bear insists that Nimble must have been waiting for him. Nimble insists that he is a deer, and not a doe, despite having no horns. Cuffy Bear is surprised that Nimble broke his promise to wait inside the cave. Nimble and Cuffy Bear are on a mountain, and Cuffy Bear says he needs to go back to his cave to get his cap. Nimble says he's not going to wait, and trots off in the direction of Cedar Swamp.

Last chunk: and see what I can find to eat."  "Very well!" Nimble agreed.  "One moment!" Cuffy Bear said hastily. "Just one moment, please! Wait  till I go inside my cave! I believe I left my cap in there."  "I'm not going to wait for you," Nimble replied firmly. "For all I know  you might not come out again till haying time."  And then Nimble trotted off down the mountainside, heading for Cedar  Swamp. For he didn't think old dog Spot would wander in that direction.
