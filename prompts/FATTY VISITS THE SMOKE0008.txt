Outline: Fatty Coon is a raccoon who is very thin after a long winter of sleeping. He decides to go to Farmer Green's house to see if he can find anything to eat. He smells something delicious coming from a small, low building and goes inside. He finds a row of hams hung up to smoke and starts to eat one. Suddenly, he is thrown to the ground and the ham falls on top of him. He is very frightened and runs all the way home. He later realizes that he had simply bitten through the cord that was holding the ham up, and it fell on him when he tried to take a bite. His children love hearing the story of his adventure.

Story so far:  Fatty would have eaten an elephant if he had the chance. He was very excited to find a ham and ate it quickly. The passage describes a man who is very hungry and does well with only one ham. He makes a hole in the ham and is about to keep going when he is suddenly thrown to the floor and the ham falls on top of him. He choked and sputtered from the ashes but soon managed to kick the ham off. Fatty Coon is very thin after a long winter of sleeping and not eating much. He goes out to look for food and is surprised at how different he looks. Fatty decides that there is no point in looking for food near his home, as the ground is covered in snow and he cannot find anything to eat. He goes to Farmer Green's place and waits there until it gets dark. Fatty was flung to the floor in a barnyard, and he ran home. A month later, he told his mother about the incident, but she didn't know what had caused it. Fatty Coon smells hams and decides to eat them. He is confident he can eat them all, even though it would be impossible. In his haste, Fatty bites through the cord that is holding up a ham in Farmer Green's smokehouse. He falls with the ham, but is unharmed. He later tells his own children about the incident.

Last chunk: exactly what had happened,  either.  "It was some sort of trap, probably," Mrs. Coon said.  But for once Mrs. Coon was mistaken.  It was very simple. In his greedy haste Fatty had merely bitten through  the cord that fastened the ham to the pole. And of course it had at once  fallen, carrying Fatty with it!  But what do you suppose? Afterward, when Fatty had grown up, and had  children of his own, he often told them about the time he had escaped  from the trap in Farmer Green's smokehouse.
