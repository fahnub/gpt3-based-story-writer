Outline: A young child goes to the market in Bonner and meets a pig without a wig. The child is amazed and asks the pig where he got such a beautiful coat. The pig replies that he was born with it and that all pigs are born with beautiful coats. The child is amazed and asks the pig if he can have one of his babies. The pig replies that all pigs are born with beautiful babies and that the child can have one if he wants.

Story so far:  A PIG is a poem about a pig without a wig. Moses Mouse runs up the chimney after Farmer Green's wife appears in the doorway and screams at the sight of Grunty Pig. In the passage, Moses Mouse and Grunty Pig are in Farmer Green's house, and Grunty Pig accidentally tips over a lamp, causing it to break. Moses Mouse tries to hide, but they are both caught by Farmer Green's family. Mrs. Green put Grunty Pig out of the farmhouse because she thought he was responsible for breaking a lamp. Grunty Pig realized that this was his opportunity to escape and ran away. Grunty Pig is in a kitchen and smells something delicious. He finds doughnuts and starts eating them all. The passage tells the story of a pig who is kept out of the farmhouse after he tells tales on Moses Mouse. He eventually stops caring and remains outside. Grunty Pig escapes from his pen and goes to the woodshed, where he finds the door to the kitchen open. He goes inside and looks around, but there is no one there. A pig named Grunty finds a mouse named Moses and tells him that the food is good. Grunty Pig finds his way into the farmhouse and is greeted by Moses Mouse. The fatter the hog got, the less it liked to roam, until Farmer Green began calling it his "prize hog."

Last chunk: bigger he was, the less he liked to roam about. And  at last Farmer Green began calling him his "prize hog."  So you can see how very fat he must have been.    THE END
