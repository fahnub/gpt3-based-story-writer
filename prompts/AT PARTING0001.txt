Last chunk: AT PARTING (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)      AND you could leave me now--    After the first remembered whispered vow    Which sings for ever and ever in my ears--    The vow which God among His Angels hears--    After the long-drawn years,    The slow hard tears,    Could break new ground, and wake    A new strange garden to blossom for your sake,    And leave me here alone,    In the old garden that was once our own?
