Story so far: The animals are planning to kill the wolf-child Mowgli, but one of the animals, Buldeo, killed a buffalo after mistaking it for the Devil-child. The village plans to torture and burn Messua and her husband for being the child's parents. The animals all agree to go ahead with the plan to destroy the fields of humans. The author sees a village at twilight and recalls when Gray Brother had waited for him there on the morning he killed Shere Khan. The author noticed that the villagers had come in from the fields earlier than usual and were gathered in a crowd. The speaker is planning to destroy a village, and Bagheera is scared. Akela is concerned that men will not leave them alone, but Gray Brother points out that they are five and can take care of themselves. Bagheera agrees, saying that they should not worry about men now. Mowgli tells the wolves that he is their leader, and they agree. He then tells them to follow him.
