Outline: Rusty Wren and his wife are looking for a new home. Rusty finds an old hollow apple tree and a hole in a fence-rail, but his wife doesn't want to live so far from the farmhouse. She suggests that they build their nest behind one of the shutters, but Rusty is worried that somebody might come to the window and close the shutter, causing their nest to fall.

Rusty eventually finds a perfect spot for their nest nailed to a tree close to Farmer Green's bedroom window. His wife is delighted and they move in right away.

Story so far:  A wren couple argue over where to build their nest, the wife wanting to be close to the farmhouse while the husband wants to be further away.

Last chunk: A PLEASANT HOME (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    Now, Rusty Wren had found--and shown to his wife--a hollow apple  tree and a hole in a fence-rail, either of which he thought would  make a pleasant place in which to live.  But since the little couple were _house wrens_, Rusty's wife said  she thought that they oughtn't to be so far from the farmhouse.  "Why not build our nest behind one of the shutters?" she  suggested.  But Rusty shook his head quickly--and with decision.  "That won't do," said he.
