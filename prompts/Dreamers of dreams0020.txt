Outline: The Story Girl came up with the idea to have everyone in their group write down their dreams in an exercise book, to see who could have the most interesting collection. They began writing down their dreams, but quickly realized that they were all having the same dream. In the dream, they were in a dark forest, being chased by a Giant. They would all wake up just before the Giant caught them. This continued for several nights until they realized that the Giant was actually Uncle Roger. They confronted him and he admitted that he had been purposely giving them all the same dream in order to scare them.

Story so far: The passage discusses different people's opinions on etiquette. The Story Girl is more lax in her views, while Cecily takes the _Family Guide_ very seriously. The passage discusses the word "deviltry," which the Story Girl says is not swearing but is still a bad word. The Story Girl says that if she wanted a boy to marry her and he wouldn't do the asking, she would ask him. Felicity says that she would rather die an old maid forty times over. The boy in the passage is talking about his father, who was a smart man but is now living in the Maine lumber woods. The boy doesn't know where his father is, but he doesn't seem to care. Dan and Felicity are talking about Mr. Campbell's new horse, Betty Sherman. Felicity thinks it's not very nice to name a horse after a person, and the Story Girl says that Betty Sherman would have thought it was a compliment. The Story Girl scolds Cecily for not telling her dream better, saying that if she had the same dream, she could tell it in a way that would make everyone else feel as if they had dreamed it too.

Last chunk: little pink cloud is a dream, getting all ready to float  down into somebody's sleep," suggested the Story Girl.  "I had a perfectly awful dream last night," said Cecily, with a shudder  of remembrance. "I dreamed I was on a desert island inhabited by tigers  and natives with two heads."  "Oh!" the Story Girl looked at Cecily half reproachfully. "Why couldn't  you tell it better than that? If I had such a dream I could tell it so  that everybody else would feel as if they had dreamed it, too."
