Story so far: A girl is transported to a dry land after she dips a cloth in the water. She lives by the sea with a lady and her maid. One day, the lady summons Elsa into her room and Elsa fears something bad is going to happen.

The children in the passage are picking strawberries when they are suddenly warned that they are in the Tontlawald, a dangerous place. They all flee except for Elsa, who is too far away and instead finds a bed of strawberries.

We are in the Tontlawald!'  Quicker than lightning they sprang to their feet, and rushed madly away, all except Elsa, who had strayed farther than the rest, and had found a bed of the finest strawberries
