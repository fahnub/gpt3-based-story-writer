Outline: Nimble, a deer, loses his horns and is sad, but he soon discovers that new horns are sprouting to take the place of his old ones. He is excited to show his friends his new horns, but he discovers that all of the other deer have new horns too. Nimble's new horns are antlers, with two points, and he is excited to show them off to his friends, particularly the other deer known as the Spike Horns. However, he soon discovers that the Spike Horns are all new deer, fawns from last year, and they are not impressed by his antlers. Nimble and his friend Dodger the Deer become known for their mock battles, which are quite realistic and exciting to watch.

Story so far:  Nimble loses his horns but manages to get through the winter without missing them too much. He eventually discovers that new horns are sprouting in their place. Dodger the Deer were known for their fighting skills. They could look and act fiercer than any of their young friends. Old Mr. Crow said it was worth flying a mile to watch one of their set-tos. Nimble the Deer is excited to show his new two-pointed antlers to his friend Dodger, but when he sees Dodger's own antlers, he realizes he isn't the only one with two points.

Last chunk: the water, a handsome pair of Y-shaped antlers, each with  two points!  "Hurrah!" he cried. "I'll make those Spike Horns feel like hiding  themselves again."  He had expected to have a pleasant time showing his new antlers to his  old friends. When he met Dodger the Deer, Nimble called to him: "See  what I've got! Antlers! Two points!"  "Ho!" said Dodger. "So have I got antlers. And they have two points,  too."  Nimble had been so interested in his own horns that he hadn't looked at  Dodger's.
