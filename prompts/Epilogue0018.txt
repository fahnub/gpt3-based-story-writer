Story so far: This passage describes the final moments of Robin Hood's life. He is on his deathbed, and Little John is taking him to see his cousin, the prioress of the nunnery near Kirklees, in Yorkshire. Robin Hood asks Little John to mark where his arrow lands so that he can be buried there. He dies shortly afterwards. Little John takes three steps forward and hurls a stone mortar at the door, breaking it open. He then runs up the winding stone steps to find his master. The prioress ties a cord around Robin Hood's arm and bleeds him, but she does not bleed him from one of his veins. The protagonist's cousin betrays him, and he is mortally wounded. He struggles to reach his bugle horn and sounds it three times before succumbing to his injuries. The prioress cuts one of Robin Hood's veins and leaves him to bleed out. The prioress of Kirklees was made prioress through King Richard's love of her, but she forgot this and was vexed when her cousin, the Earl of Huntingdon, threw away his earldom and went back to Sherwood. The passage tells the end of the story of Robin Hood, who returns to Nottinghamshire after many years. His friends Little John and Will Scarlet have also returned, and both are doing well. Sir William Dale is tasked by the King to lead an army to capture Robin Hood. The Sheriff of Nottingham was killed in a fight in the forest, along with many other men. Sir William Dale was wounded and withdrew, beaten.
