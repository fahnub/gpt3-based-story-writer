Outline: The story is about a frog who is a tailor and the beaver family who are his customers. The frog is trying to collect payment from the beavers for their new clothes, but the beavers refuse to pay, saying that it's not fashionable to do so. The frog then tricks the beavers into paying him by pretending that he will make their clothes for free if they promise to wear them. The beavers agree and the frog gets his payment. In the end, the frog laughs at the beavers for their new clothes and for falling for his trick.

Story so far:  In this fable, Mr. Frog tries to convince the Beaver family that they need to pay him for their new suits, even though it is not fashionable to do so. The Beavers object, but Mr. Frog insists. In the end, the Beavers are forced to pay and learn their lesson. Mr. Frog asks Stingy Steve to pay him back sixty tape-measures, which is what he borrowed. Steve gives him one back and runs away. This passage describes the speaker's feelings towards people who are "a bit like them." The speaker seems to have mixed feelings, perhaps feeling both attracted to and repelled by these people.
