Story so far:  The passage describes a black and white dog who is particular about keeping his long hair neatly parted in the middle. Benny was a beaver who loved to dig holes. He was so good at it that other animals sometimes used his holes as homes. Benny dug so many holes that some of his neighbors started to object.

Last chunk: short, stout legs, and big feet, which bore long, strongclaws. And when he started to dig his way into somebody else's home hecertainly did make the dirt fly.  He was so fond of digging that he even dug countless holes of his own,just for the fun it gave him--so far as anybody could find out. And ifhe had only left other folk's holes alone some of his neighbors wouldnot have objected to his favorite sport. For more than one fox andcoyote had been known to make his home in a hole dug by Benny
