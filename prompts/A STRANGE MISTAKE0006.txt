Outline: Rusty Wren and Mr. Frog are on their way to a party at Rusty's cousin Long Bill Wren's house. When they arrive, they are surprised to see that there are no other guests and no signs of a party. Long Bill comes out and explains that there was a mix-up with the invitations and they are actually a year late. Rusty and Mr. Frog have a pleasant chat with Long Bill and then Rusty goes home.
