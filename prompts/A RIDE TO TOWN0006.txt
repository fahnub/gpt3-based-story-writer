Outline: Johnnie Green and his new pet lamb, Snowball, become friends. Johnnie's old dog, Spot, is not pleased with the new addition to the family. He tells the Muley Cow that he is jealous of Snowball and that the lamb is stupid.

The Muley Cow tells Spot that Johnnie will eventually grow tired of the lamb and that the other boys will tease him. Sure enough, Johnnie's father takes him to town and Snowball follows. Johnnie has to lift Snowball into the wagon and take him home.

One day, Johnnie says something that causes Spot to speak his mind to the Muley Cow. Johnnie Green delivers Snowball to the village and back, and both are pleased with the trip. Henrietta Hen is the only one who does not share in the wonder of Snowball's story.
