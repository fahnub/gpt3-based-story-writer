Outline: Frisky Squirrel is caught in the attic of Farmer Green's house during a storm. He is frightened and cannot eat the nuts in the attic. When the storm passes, he finds a small opening in the door and escapes to the kitchen. He is pursued by Farmer Green's cat, but he escapes by climbing a tree.

Story so far:  Frisky Squirrel sees an animal spring out from behind the stove and start chasing him. He assumes it is a small dog, but does not stop to take a good look. Frisky Squirrel is captured by Farmer Green's Cat and imprisoned in the attic. Frisky is so frightened that he shivers in a corner and does not eat. All he wants is to be free and outside. The small animal cannot fly, and is forced to watch Frisky Squirrel as he jumps from branch to branch until she can no longer see him.

Last chunk: fly, as well as climb  trees. He scampered to the top of the tree; and then he leaped upon a  branch of another tree close by.  No! The small animal could not fly. She climbed as high as she dared.  And then she stopped. Her eyes glared fiercely; and her tail grew as  big as Frisky's own. But that didn't help her at all. She could only  sit there and watch Frisky Squirrel as he dropped from branch to  branch, until she lost sight of him among the leaves.
