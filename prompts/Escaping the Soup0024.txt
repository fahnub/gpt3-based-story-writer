Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

Story so far:  The Queen asks if the children think she's beautiful, and they all say no. The Scoodler hurls the head of the shaggy man's head at the Rainbow's Daughter, but the shaggy man catches it and puts it in a sack. The body of the guard runs around aimlessly, and the shaggy man easily dodges it and opens the door to the big cave. The passage describes the characters' relief at leaving the cave and getting back onto the familiar path.

Last chunk: soup for some time to come.  So now, anxious to get away from the horrid gloomy cave as soon as  possible, they hastened up the hillside and regained the road just  beyond the place where they had first met the Scoodlers; and you may be  sure they were glad to find their feet on the old familiar path again.
