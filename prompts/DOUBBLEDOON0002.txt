Outline: Bobbin goes for a ride on his rocking-horse to the town of Doubbledoon. Once there, he sees a number of strange sights: an Arab throwing bubbles at the moon, a monkey making faces, a rabbit in a rage, and a parrot shouting "Murder!" from its cage. Bobbin is then chased by a jumping-jack, a camel, and a raccoon all the way back home.
