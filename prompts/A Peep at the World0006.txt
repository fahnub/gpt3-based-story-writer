Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is exploring the world outside of his nest for the first time and is amazed by all the new sights and sounds. His mother warns him of the dangers of venturing too far from home, but he doesn't listen and eventually meets a kitten from the farmhouse. The kitten is friendly at first, but then tries to catch Master Meadow Mouse. He barely escapes and runs all the way home to his mother. She scolds him and he promises to never wander too far from home again.

Story so far:  The passage describes a child's curiosity about the sky, and their surprise at how big and far away it seems when they finally get a chance to touch it. Master Meadow Mouse's earliest memory is of lying in a nest of dried grasses in darkness or light, depending on whether it was night or day. He could see a shaft of light coming through a hole in the ceiling, and beyond that was the sky. Mrs. Meadow Mouse took her son above ground and taught him how to find food and stay safe. He eventually began to wander further from home, thinking his mother was too careful.

Last chunk: others the food that his mother brought home to him,  he grew fast. It wasn't long before Mrs. Meadow Mouse took him above  ground with her and let him play near home.  She taught him many things--how to find ripe seeds to eat, how to keep  still as a mouse and not squeak when there was danger of any kind, and  how to dodge into their tunnel when there was need.  Little by little Master Meadow Mouse wandered further from his own  dooryard. And he began to think that his mother was too careful.
