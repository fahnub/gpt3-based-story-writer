Outline: Grunty Pig insists that his tail is the most beautiful in the neighborhood, but old dog Spot points out that it would be more convenient if it were nailed to the outside of the barn. Grunty Pig is reluctant to part with his tail, but Spot persuades him to see how tailless pigs look. Grunty Pig squeezes through a hole in the fence to follow Spot, but gets stuck.

It seems to me you'd be more at your ease. It would certainly  be _polite_ of you."  Grunty Pig, however, cared little for politeness. He said that nobody  was polite to him. His brothers--and even his sisters--were always  knocking him down and trampling on him.  "Very well!" said Spot. "Squirm through that fence and follow
