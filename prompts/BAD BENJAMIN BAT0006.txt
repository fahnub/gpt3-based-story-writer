Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A young boy has a series of encounters with different animals, impressing those around him. However, the Muley Cow is unhappy with him for being too nice to Twinkleheels. The passage also describes a man who was beaten for spelling his name wrong. Ben is excited to go get him. Miss Celia gives the Italian her address and asks him to let her know if he finds Sanch. Nox, on the other hand, likes cold water, has white teeth and glossy hair, and is always well-groomed. Benjamin Bat asked Freddie Firefly to ask Farmer Green to step outside for a moment because Bat was not feeling well and was afraid he was going to be ill. Ben offers Bab the silver arrow rosette, which she accepts. The passage describes three boys who are investigating a black dog that they believe may be dangerous. They interview the dog's owner and get more information about the dog. Thorny writes to a cousin in New York, asking him to look into the matter and make sure that everything is okay. Ben sneezed, threw down the roses, and then hid because he didn't want to be seen. He heard Mrs. Moss and Betty talking about a window and a shed, and when they left he found it and came in. The window was broken, and he came through it. The speaker is sad because they cannot have the dog they want, and Thorny offers to let them have any of his pets instead. The passage describes a little girl named Bab who is competing in an archery contest. She is hoping to win, but is also worried about making her rival, Ben, feel bad if she beats him. Miss Celia tells her that sometimes losing can make someone happier than winning, and that she should be proud of herself even if she doesn't win. Freddie is considering putting out his light to stop the mosquitoes from coming, but Benjamin Bat suggests that if Freddie puts out his light, maybe his relations will too and they will be doing a good turn for Farmer Green.

Last chunk: that a light always draws mosquitoes? And it can't be very pleasant  for Farmer Green to have half the mosquitoes in the neighborhood  crowding into his dooryard."  "What would be the use of my putting out my light, when all my relations  are flashing theirs?" Freddie asked.  "Well, maybe they'd follow your example," Benjamin Bat suggested. "And  just think what a good turn you'd be doing Farmer Green!"
