Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes a competition between two marksmen, one of whom is a shy boy named Ben. When the old lady catches Ben's jacket, she begins to question him, and it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard. Benjamin Bat is greatly surprised when Freddie Firefly suggests that it would be just as jolly for Benjamin to be eaten by Solomon Owl as it would be for Freddie to be eaten by Benjamin. Sancho is happy because he thinks their troubles are over and he won't have to go foraging anymore. Betty is putting more wood in the stove.

Last chunk: through sun and rain. Sancho was in great spirits, evidently  feeling that their woes were over and his foraging expeditions at an  end, for he frisked about his master with yelps of pleasure, or made  playful darts at the ankles of his benefactress, which caused her to  cry, "Whish!" and "Scat!" and shake her skirts at him as if he were a  cat or hen.  A hot fire was roaring in the stove under the broth-skillet and  tea-kettle, and Betty was poking in more wood, with a great smirch of  black on
