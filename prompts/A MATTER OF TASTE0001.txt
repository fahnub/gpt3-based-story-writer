Outline: The big black ant is very grateful to the ladybug for her offer to take him home, but he explains that he has to hurry and milk his cows. He tells her that the aphid herds on the aster boughs provide him with milk, and that he believes that his cows are best when turned to beef. The ladybug is horrified by this idea and quickly leaves.

Story so far:  The big black ant and the ladybug have a discussion about the merits of milk versus beef. The ladybug believes that cows are best when turned to beef, while the ant argues that milk is a superior product.

Last chunk: A MATTER OF TASTE (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      "Thank you, dear," said the big black ant,    "I'd like to go home with you now, but I can't.    I have to hurry and milk my cows--    The aphid herds on the aster boughs."    And the ladybug said: "No doubt it's fine,    This milk you get from your curious kine,    But you know quite well it's my belief    Your cows are best when turned to beef."
