The boy and his dog are always together, and the children think they are a great team. Ben used to copy the signs on the wagons, and this is how he learned to read. He remembers his father being proud of him when he read the word 'lion' correctly. The passage describes a scene in which a dog brings a leaf to two little girls, who read it aloud. The leaf contains a message about a pleasant land. Ben is interested in learning more about history, so Bab offers to lend him her book and tell him all about it. Betty suggests that Ben borrow her arithmetic book so that he can learn how to add and subtract, since he will soon be earning wages. Ben gives the children a lesson in natural history which is so interesting that they are happy and occupied until bedtime.
