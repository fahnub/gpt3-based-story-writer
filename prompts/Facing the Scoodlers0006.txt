Outline: Dorothy and her companions are traveling through a rocky, barren landscape when they are suddenly confronted by a group of strange creatures. These creatures, known as Scoodlers, are black on one side and white on the other, with two faces on either side of their head. They are also very thin, with long fingers and toes.

The Scoodlers tell the group that they want to make them into soup, and begin to advance on them menacingly. The shaggy man tries to reason with them, but they will not listen. He then picks up a stone and throws it at them, which only seems to anger them further.

Two of the Scoodlers pick up their heads and hurl them at the shaggy man, knocking him to the ground. They then pick up their heads and put them back on their shoulders before returning to their perches on the rocks.

Dorothy and the others are now surrounded by the Scoodlers, who are blocking the path ahead of them. The shaggy man gets up and dusts himself off, and they all begin to back away slowly. The Scoodlers follow them, still threatening to make them into soup, but eventually they lose interest and turn back.

Dorothy and her companions are relieved, but Button-Bright is still upset and wants to know why the Scoodlers wanted to make them into soup. The shaggy man explains that it is probably because they are made of different materials than the Scoodlers, and that they probably think that they would make a tasty soup.

With the Scoodlers now gone, the group is able to continue on their journey. They eventually come to a fork in the road, and must decide which way to go.

The creature was black all over, except for its yellow hair, which was cut short at the sides and bangs across the forehead.
