Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A young boy has encounters with different animals and impresses those around him, but the Muley Cow is unhappy with him for being too nice to Twinkleheels. The passage describes a festive scene in which various flags are waving and the cook is preparing breakfast to the tune of "St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." Duke the horse and Ben the boy become friends, and the Squire sees this and allows Ben to harness Duke to the chaise. A young boy named Alfred Tennyson Barlow arrives at a shooting party and asks if there will be any little cakes. The ladies at the party giggle at his remarks. A twelve-year-old boy named Ben Brown is traveling alone and looking for work. He tells a woman he is capable of doing any kind of work and is especially good with horses. The woman is concerned because he is so young and asks if he has any family. This passage tells the story of Benjamin Bat, who is always on the move and never stops to think about how lucky he is to be able to travel so easily. Barton and his dog Sancho have been given new clothes and have been cleaned up.

Last chunk: Barton's faded flannel suit, with an unbleached cotton  shirt out of the Dorcas basket, and a pair of Milly Cutter's old shoes  on his feet.  Sancho also had been put in better trim, for, after his master had  refreshed himself with a warm bath, he gave his dog a good scrub while  Mrs. Moss set a stitch here and there in the new old clothes; and Sancho  reappeared, looking more like the china poodle than ever, being as white  as snow, his curls well brushed up, and his tasselly tail waving
