Outline: The rats and mice on the farm think that Miss Kitty Cat is a terrible person because she loves to hunt them. However, they also think it's pleasant to have her around because she can predict the weather. When old dog Spot chases her, she can be quite fierce. But around the farmhouse, she is always polite and never makes a fuss.

Johnnie Green likes Miss Kitty and often pets her. If he were her size and she were his, she might play with him like she does with a mouse. But Johnnie Green never stops to think of anything like that.

Story so far:  Miss Kitty was always polite and never caused any trouble, even though she might have been hungry or cold. Miss Kitty Cat is usually calm and collected, but when old dog Spot chases her, she can be quite ferocious.

Last chunk: frightful. Almost always she  appeared quite unruffled, going about her business in a quiet way and  making no fuss over anything. Of course when old dog Spot chased--and  cornered--her, she was quite a different sort of creature. Then she  arched her back, puffed her tail out to twice its usual size, and spat  fiercely at Spot. He learned not to get within reach of her sharp claws,  when she behaved in that fashion. For old Spot had a tender nose. And no  one knew it better than Miss Kitty Cat.
