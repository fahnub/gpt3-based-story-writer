Outline: Ferdinand Frog meets a Great Blue Heron and is impressed by the size of his bill. The heron tells Ferdinand that he is moving into the area and Ferdinand is immediately worried that the heron will eat him. The heron reassures Ferdinand that he is not interested in eating frogs and the two become friends. Ferdinand is amazed by the heron's bill and says that it would be useful for making button-holes. The heron is amused by this comment and flies away.

Story so far: A vain bird is pleased when a frog compliments its bill, but lives far from the frog. Miss Kitty Cat knows the way back to her home, although she couldn't tell you how she knows. The famous race between Grumpy Weasel and Jimmy Rabbit goes on, with Jimmy trying to lose the weasel. Jimmy grows tired and stopped to rest, but Grumpy Weasel never stopped once. Ferdinand Frog is relieved to find out that the huge bird he encountered is not a grizzly bear, but is instead G. B. Heron. Miss Kitty Cat frightens some birds by sharpening her claws, then sets off for home. Mr. Crow gives Jimmy Rabbit some advice and Jimmy Rabbit runs away as Grumpy Weasel comes racing along. Kitty walks for three days and nights until she reaches her home. Ferdinand Frog is upset because he thinks he is too fat, but Mr. Heron tells him he looks good. Ferdinand is pleased and says that he has always been satisfied with himself until he saw Mr. Heron.

"You look good to me."  And now it was Mr. Frog's turn to be pleased; for he was very vain.  "I'm glad to hear it!" he cried. "And I'll tell you a secret: I've  always been quite satisfied with myself until my eyes fell on you. Oh!  if I only had such a bill as yours!"  "You like my bill, then?" Mr. Heron asked him.
