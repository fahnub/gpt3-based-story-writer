Story so far: This passage contains a series of vignettes about animals with different personality traits. It also includes a description of a funeral procession, in which the speaker reflects on their own mortality. Farmer Green played a joke on his flock of sheep by shearing them. Snowball, who didn't belong to the flock, found it amusing. The passage describes how Benny Badger's face scares away ground squirrels, even though it is not particularly frightening. The speaker expects to wait for the wagon, stay at the fair as long as it lasts, and come home when the wagon brings her. She plans to wear her best apron and see the races.

Last chunk: to let her neighbors find out how little she  knew about fairs. She said that before starting she expected to wait for  the wagon, that she hoped to stay at the fair as long as it lasted  (because she didn't want to miss anything!) and that she intended to come  home when the wagon brought her. Furthermore, she planned to wear her  best apron, anyhow, because there was sure to be fair weather at a fair!  How could it be otherwise?  Old Ebenezer, the horse, told her to be sure to see the races.
