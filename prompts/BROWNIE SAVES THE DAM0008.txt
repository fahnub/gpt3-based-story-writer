Outline: The story is set in a village near a pond which is in danger of being flooded. Brownie Beaver, who has been advised by his grandfather to prepare for the possibility of a flood, is the only one who has done so. When the flood comes, all the villagers have to scramble to save their houses while Brownie and his grandfather are the only ones with nothing to do.

Brownie Beaver swims over to the dam and finds that his grandfather is worried that it will be washed away. Brownie decides to try and save it and does so by swimming into the torrent and making the spillways bigger. He has many close calls but eventually succeeds in saving the dam. The village is very grateful and wants to give him a gold-headed cane, but he decline saying that he rarely walks on land and that it would be of no use to him when he swims.

Story so far:  Brownie Beaver's village is saved from a flood by his preparations. This passage describes how the other animals in the village did not help Beaver save the dam, because they were too busy working on their own homes. Beaver knew there was nothing more he could do to make his house safe, so he went to the dam to help, but found no one there. The passage describes a beaver pond that is full and running over, and the likelihood that the dam will be carried away. It notes that there is almost no one left to work on the dam, and that people never stopped to think about it. Brownie Beaver thinks carrying a cane while swimming is silly.

Last chunk: Brownie Beaver heard of that he said it was just as well, becausehe seldom walked far on land and there wasn't much use in a person'scarrying a cane when he swam, anyhow. Although it was sometimes done,he had always considered it a silly practice--and one that he wouldnot care to follow.
