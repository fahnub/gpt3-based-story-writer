Outline: The rooster is afraid of Turkey Proudfoot, but he is forced to defend Henrietta Hen when Turkey Proudfoot threatens to eat one of her chicks. The rooster is no match for Turkey Proudfoot, who easily defeats him. However, the rooster is saved when Henrietta Hen and her chicks run away.

Story so far:  The passage tells of a rooster who is worried that Turkey Proudfoot will hurt him because the rooster's owner brought her chicks out where Turkey could see them. The rooster tries to act brave by confronting Turkey, but Turkey is confused because the rooster's behavior is unusual.

Last chunk: muttered as he marched across the farmyard. "I  don't see why she wanted to bring her chicks out here where Turkey  Proudfoot would see them. She's landed me in a scrape. There won't be  much left of me when that old gobbler gets through with me."  Nevertheless the rooster put on a bold front. Drawing himself up to look  his tallest, he glared at Turkey Proudfoot and said shrilly, "What do  you mean by annoying this lady?"  Turkey Proudfoot gulped. He wondered what had come over his neighbors.
