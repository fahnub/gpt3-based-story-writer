Outline: Johnnie Green's father tells him that owning a cow is a big responsibility, and Johnnie soon learns that this means he has to do things like milk her, even if he'd rather be doing something else. The Muley Cow is always escaping to the back pasture, and Johnnie has to chase her down each time. He eventually turns this into a game, pretending to hunt her like a buffalo, but the Muley Cow is not amused. One day, she gets revenge by holding back her milk when Johnnie tries to milk her.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green used to call his old cow "Muley Cow." If he didn't see her, he knew she was in the back pasture again. The back pasture was overgrown and offered a fine hiding place for the cow. Sometimes it took Johnnie a good hour to find her. The passage describes how a boy named Johnnie Green came to own a Muley Cow, and how the cow soon learned that Johnnie would always come for her, no matter where she went. The Muley Cow enjoyed making Johnnie work for her, as she felt it was good for him. However, Johnnie did not seem to share this view, and generally tried to avoid work whenever possible. Johnnie Green finds that there are times when he would rather not have to milk his cow.

Last chunk: BUFFALO HUNTS (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)    Johnnie Green found, after a while, that owning a cow wasn't all fun.  There were times when he would have been willing to let his father, or  the hired man, milk the Muley Cow. For instance, a boy from a  neighboring farm might come along about milking-time with a fine plan  for play. Or someone driving past the house on his way to the village  might ask Johnnie to go along too.  Once or twice, on such occasions, Johnnie tried to wriggle out of  milking.
