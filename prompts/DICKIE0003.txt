Outline: Dickie Deer Mouse is busy gathering cat-tail down in Cedar Swamp to line his nest with. He makes a roof out of moss and is very proud of his home. All his Deer Mouse relations think it's a great house, but the birds think it's a trap. Dickie is happy in his home and likes to watch the goings-on from inside with just his head poking out. He knows he needs to be vigilant, as he is often the prey of owls and other predators. If they knew he was inside his home, they could easily tear it apart, but luckily they don't know.

Story so far:  The passage describes a bird making its nest, using various materials to line and roof it. The bird is pleased with the result. Dickie Deer Mouse knows he needs sharp eyes to spy on him when he is peeping from his house in that fashion. Dickie Deer Mouse has made improvements to his house, which his Deer Mouse relations approve of. However, the birds do not like the house, with Long Bill Wren being the only one who doesn't mind it. Jasper Jay thinks the house is ruined and is afraid to sleep inside it.

Last chunk: "improvements," as he called the  additions he had made. And all his Deer Mouse relations told him that he  certainly had a fine place.  But none of the birds cared for it at all, except Long Bill Wren; and  even he remarked that the house would be better "if it was rounder."  As for Jasper Jay, he told Dickie Deer Mouse that, in his opinion, the  house was ruined.  "It's nothing but a trap," he declared. "And I'd hate to go to sleep  inside it."  His views, however, did not trouble Dickie Deer
