Outline: A little boy goes to the barber to get his hair cut. The barber asks him how many hairs he wants cut and the boy replies "four and twenty." The barber then proceeds to shave the boy's hair and gives him a pinch of snuff.

Story so far:  A beetle sits on a twig and uses its thingum-a-jig to make things for other animals.

Last chunk: A BEETLE ONCE SAT ON A BARBERRY TWIG (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      A beetle once sat on a barberry twig,    And turned at the crank of a thingum-a-jig.    Needles for hornets, nippers for ants,    For the bumblebee baby a new pair of pants,    For the grizzled old gopher a hat and a wig,    The beetle ground out of his thingum-a-jig.    [Illustration]
