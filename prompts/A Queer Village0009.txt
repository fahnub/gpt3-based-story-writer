Outline: Dorothy, the shaggy man, Toto, and Button-Bright are taken prisoner by foxes and led to the royal palace. The fox king questions them and is pleased to learn they are friends. The king tells Dorothy that everyone knows who she is and that she is an important personage since Princess Ozma of Oz made her her friend. The king also reveals that Ozma is going to celebrate her birthday on the twenty-first of the month and expresses his hope to get an invitation.

Dorothy is surprised to learn that they are not in Kansas anymore and that they have been transported to Foxville in Fairyland. The fox king tells her that she can return to Kansas if she wishes, but Dorothy decides to stay and explore Foxville instead.

Story so far: The fox king and his soldiers come to Kansas to find Dorothy and her friends. The fox captain demands their surrender and tells Button-Bright that he is a prisoner. The Fox-King is surprised to learn that the girl he is talking to thinks they are in Kansas. The little girl is content with her life in Kansas, and is not worried about her Aunt Em. The Fox-King approves of this attitude and tells the girl that her new companion (the fox) is very clever and bright. The shaggy man assures Dorothy that he is not to blame for her journey, and that he himself has been feeling strange since he owned the Love Magnet. Button-Bright and the shaggy man come across a big, beautifully decorated arch. It is adorned with peacocks and a fox's head, among other things. The soldiers march the shaggy man, Dorothy, Toto, and Button-Bright back through the arch to the royal palace. There they find a big city with beautiful marble houses. The shaggy man's love magnet is working and all the foxes love him now. Toto doesn't know this and tries to bite the captain's leg. Dorothy tells Toto to stop and explains that the foxes are their friends. This passage describes the decorations in a village made up of foxes. The decorations are mostly birds and other fowl, and each doorway has a carving of the head of a fox representing the inhabitant of that house. Some of the foxes come out to get a view of the strangers marching through the village.

Last chunk: The decorations were  mostly birds and other fowl, such as peacocks, pheasants, turkeys,  prairie-chickens, ducks, and geese.  Over each doorway was carved a  head representing the fox who lived in that house, this effect being  quite pretty and unusual.  As our friends marched along, some of the foxes came out on the porches  and balconies to get a view of the strangers.  These foxes were all  handsomely dressed, the girl-foxes and women-foxes wearing gowns of  feathers woven together
