Outline: Nimble, a young fawn, sneaks away from his mother while she's sleeping and into the woods. He's careful not to make any noise and disturb her. As he's exploring, he comes across a fox perched in a tree. He's never seen a fox before, but he knows they're supposed to be sly creatures with bushy tails and long, pointy noses. He stares at it for a moment before realizing that it's actually a raccoon.

He hurriedly runs back to his mother to tell her what he saw. She's relieved that it was just a raccoon and not a fox, but scolds him for wandering off into the woods by himself. She teaches him that foxes are actually red, with no rings on their tails, and they don't climb trees. Nimble is glad to learn this and is also glad that his mother didn't ask him how he ended up in the woods alone.

Nimble's mother tells him that the fox he saw was actually a raccoon, and Nimble is glad to learn the difference. A fox was in a tree, and Nimble's mother asked him about it. A fawn is careful not to make any noise as he leaves to play, so as not to wake his mother. Nimble's mother is a light sleeper and always has one ear cocked to listen for any noise in the forest. She didn't realize her son was gone until she woke up and saw he wasn't there.

Last chunk: and discover that he had left her.  So Nimble trod only upon the soft carpet of pine needles and made not  the slightest noise. Meanwhile his mother slept peacefully on--or as  peacefully as anybody can who is a light sleeper and keeps one ear  always cocked to catch every stir in the forest.  She never missed her son at all until she found herself suddenly wide  awake and on her feet, ready to run. Not seeing Nimble beside her, for a  moment or two she forgot she had a child. Her only thought
