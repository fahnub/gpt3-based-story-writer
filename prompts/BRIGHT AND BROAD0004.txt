Outline: Farmer Green has a pair of oxen, Bright and Broad, who are very strong but quite slow. Twinkleheels, Farmer Green's pony, is much faster but not nearly as strong. The bays in the barnyard tell Twinkleheels that Bright and Broad are actually quite fast and could easily beat him in a race. Twinkleheels doesn't believe them and challenges the oxen to a race. Bright and Broad agree, but when Twinkleheels asks them if the bays were telling the truth, they simply say that he hasn't asked them a question yet. Twinkleheels is surprised and asks them if they're actually faster than he is. They confirm that they are, and Twinkleheels is shocked. The oxen explain that they're often called upon to do things that require a lot of strength but not much speed, like pulling a heavy load or wagon out of a mud hole. Twinkleheels decides not to race them after all, realizing that he would never be able to win.

Story so far:  The speaker is surprised to learn that the people he is talking to know about him. The passage describes how Twinkleheels spoke to some cows, who listened with a dreamy look in their eyes. Twinkleheels paused, expecting them to speak, but they said nothing. Finally, Twinkleheels asked them a question, to which they replied that they hadn't been asked a question. Farmer Green has a pair of oxen, Bright and Broad, who are very different from his pony, Twinkleheels. Bright and Broad are huge and slow-moving, and they never frisk or play like Twinkleheels does. When they do move faster than a walk, they lurch into a strange, shambling swing that makes Twinkleheels giggle. Twinkleheels is a horse who doesn't like Bright and Broad, two other horses, because they are too serious and never seem to have any fun. One day, he tells them that he used to think he was faster than Ebenezer, another horse, but Ebenezer showed him that he was wrong. The bays tell Twinkleheels that Bright and Broad are actually faster than he thinks they are, and that Farmer Green has been known to take them instead of the bays when he's in a hurry. Twinkleheels speaks to Bright and Broad the next day, and they confirm what the bays said. The speaker is boastful, saying that he could beat any other horse in a race, even if he had to let the other horses choose the course. The other horses are not impressed, and think that the speaker is overestimating his abilities.

Last chunk: I was mistaken. But I can  certainly beat Bright and Broad. They're the slowest pair I ever saw."  The bays glanced at each other.  "You can't always tell by a person's looks what he can do," one of them  remarked. "Let Bright and Broad choose the race course and they'd leave  you behind."  "Nonsense!" Twinkleheels cried. "They couldn't beat anybody unless it's  Timothy Turtle, who lives over in Black Creek."  The bays winked at each other over the low partition that separated  their stalls.
