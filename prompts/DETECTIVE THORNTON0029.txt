Story so far: The speaker likes Thorny because he is a bit of a sneak, and Miss Celia laughs and says that Thorny is the finest peacock on the place. Miss Celia is trying to comfort Ben and convince Thorny that she is not a thief. She leads them to the dressing room, where Thorny plans to keep an eye on her until the matter is resolved. The speaker has a small but cozy home. The girl tells her brother that she thinks Ben took her money, because she trusts him more than the other girls. Thorny and Ben argue over whether or not a horse belongs to Ben. Ben insists that it does, while Thorny mutters that it's a lie. Celia, who is watching, looks puzzled.
