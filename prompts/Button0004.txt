Story so far: The Ork, the Bumpy Man, and Button-Bright meet and discuss their next steps. The Ork reflects on the question and says that he could carry one of the children on his back, but three adults would be too much. He suggests that they made a mistake in eating the purple berries so soon. The Bumpy Man shovels snow and finds someone buried in it. The shaggy man decides to call the boy Button-Bright, after his mother does. Button-Bright is curious about the Ork's tail, and asks to see how it works. The Ork explains that it is his tail and he reserves the right to whirl it himself. Button-Bright then proposes they go out and fly somewhere so he can see how the tail works. The Ork declines, saying he only flies when he is going somewhere. Button-Bright is digging a hole when the shaggy man comes along and tells him that he should come with them. Toto, who has been watching the boy dig, becomes excited and starts barking. The Ork is scornful of birds, calling them "dreadful creatures" covered in feathers. Trot disagrees, saying she thinks they're beautiful. The Ork gets angry and goes back into the house. Button-Bright tries to catch one of the birds, but it's too strong and nearly carries him away. He lets go and the bird flies back down. The passage describes Cap'n Bill's thoughts on how to solve the problem of the shrinking people. He believes that if the purple berries make anything grow bigger, they could find a way out of their troubles. The others do not understand his speech, and just then a chorus of shrill cries is heard from outside. The Bumpy Man tells Trot that the birds she caught are educated to talk, and asks Cap'n Bill to let them go. The passage describes a conversation between a group of birds and a man who is asking them to carry him and his companions. The birds are initially reluctant, but the man assures them that he can make them big and strong enough to do it. They agree, and he proceeds to use his magic to make them large enough to carry the group. The shaggy man says that every road leads somewhere, so he and Dorothy will eventually find a place if they keep travelling. He doesn't know where they will end up, but they will find out when they get there. The Bumpy Man tells Trot that the snow in Mo is good to eat, and that the only downside is that there is sometimes too much of it. Trot finds that the popcorn is crisp and slightly warm, and enjoys it.

Last chunk: country, and when  you're in Mo you must do as the Momen do. Eat some of our snow, and you  will find it is good. The only fault I find with our snow is that we  get too much of it at times."  With this the Bumpy Man set to work shoveling a path and he was so  quick and industrious that he piled up the popcorn in great banks on  either side of the trail that led to the mountain-top from the plains  below. While he worked, Trot ate popcorn and found it crisp and  slightly warm, as well as nicely
