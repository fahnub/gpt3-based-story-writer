Outline: Betsy Butterfly and Mrs. Ladybug are surrounded by a crowd of field people who are curious about the dust on Betsy's wings. Butterfly Bill, a cousin of Betsy's, tells Mrs. Ladybug that the dust is what gives butterflies their beautiful colors and that if she tries to brush it off, she'll have every one of them in her hair. Mrs. Ladybug is upset and drops her brush.

Bill then tells Mrs. Ladybug that there is a rumor going around that her house is on fire and that her children are in danger. Mrs. Ladybug starts weeping, and Bill tells her that she ought to mind her own business.

Jennie Junebug arrives on the scene and overhears Bill. She threatens to knock him down if he was talking about her or Mrs. Ladybug. Bill denies it and flees in terror.

Mrs. Ladybug comments on what a peculiar lot the Butterfly family is.

Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug's paintbrush falls to the ground after her cousin tells her that her children are in danger from Freddie Firefly. Butterfly Bill is warning Mrs. Ladybug not to touch his cousin with a brush, because the dust on them is what gives them their beautiful colors. Bill sees that Jennie Junebug is the one who spoke to him. She had noticed the crowd from a distance and had just arrived, quite out of breath. Jennie actually threatens Bill, saying she will have to knock him down if he was talking about her. Bill knows that Jennie enjoys flying into people after dark, but he did not know she only did this unladylike trick then. Butterfly Bill flew away in fright after JennieJunebug said she hoped he didn't mean her friend Mrs. Ladybug. Mrs. Ladybug noticed the dust on his wings and muttered that the Butterfly family are a peculiar lot.

Last chunk: said hastily.  "And I hope you didn't mean my friend Mrs. Ladybug, either," JennieJunebug added. "For if you did----"  But Butterfly Bill waited to hear no more. Thoroughly frightened, hesought safety in flight. And as he flew away Mrs. Ladybug couldn't helpnoticing the dust on his wings.  "They're certainly a peculiar lot--that Butterfly family!" shemuttered.
