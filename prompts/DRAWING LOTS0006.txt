Outline: Buster Bumblebee's mother tells her forty-nine honey-makers that Freddie Firefly and at least forty-eight of his relations are expected at the Bumblebees' house at dusk. Each Firefly will provide a light for the honey-makers to use while they work in the clover field at night. The honey-makers are angry about having to work half the night, and one of them tries to escape when they are told they will have to draw lots to see who goes with Freddie. The one who tries to escape is the one who is chosen, and she is the worst-tempered of the bunch. Freddie begins to wish he had gone to the dance at the swamp.

Story so far:  The honey-makers are unhappy with the recent announcement and blame Buster for it. The Queen Bumblebee tells her forty-nine honey-makers that Freddie Firefly and his forty-eight relatives are coming over at dusk, and each Firefly will provide a light for the bees to work by in the clover field. After midnight, they can sleep until dawn. Freddie Firefly offers to take one of the Queen's workers to the clover-patch to help with the light, as he is unable to provide enough light himself. Queen Bumblebee is waiting for Freddie Firefly to arrive with the rest of his family. The honey-makers are angry and not sleepy, and the Queen is glad. Freddie Firefly is gathering clover nectar with a surly bumblebee. The queen tells the honey-makers that one of them will have to go with Freddie to the clover field, and they agree. However, when it comes time to draw lots, the worker who had tried to escape is the one who is chosen.

Last chunk: Queen said that that was a good idea. And the honey-makers, who had  come outside the house, all agreed that it was a fine suggestion. But  not one of them wanted to go with Freddie.  "Then you'll have to draw lots," the Queen told them severely.  When the honey-makers heard that, one of them tried to slip away. But  the Queen saw her and called her back.  Then they drew lots. And strange to say, the worker who had tried to  escape proved to be the unlucky one who was doomed to go to the clover
