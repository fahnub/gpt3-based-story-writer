Outline: Miss Kitty Cat is perched on top of Rusty Wren's tin house, enjoying herself and teasing the birds, when she suddenly hears a strange catcall. She can't see where it's coming from, but the birds all start warning her about the mysterious stranger. Miss Kitty Cat is determined to find the source of the noise and teach them a lesson, but no matter where she looks, she can't find anyone.

The catcalls continue, moving from one place to another, and Miss Kitty Cat starts to wonder if there's simply a disembodied voice jeering at her. Finally, she comes face to face with the culprit: Mr. Catbird, who has been imitating a cat to tease her. The other birds all join in, making so much noise that Miss Kitty Cat retreats to the haymow to get away from them.

Story so far:  The birds are excited because a strange, mocking cat has arrived, and Miss Kitty Cat is angry. She challenges the cat to a fight. Miss Kitty Cat is startled to hear another cat meow, but can't see where it's coming from.

Last chunk: CATCALLS (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)    PERCHED on top of Rusty Wren's tin house, Miss Kitty Cat had been  enjoying herself thoroughly, while the birds made a great how-dy-do and  tried in vain to frighten her away.  When she heard all at once an unexpected _meaow_ she showed that it  startled her.  "A cat!" cried Miss Kitty. "I didn't suppose there was another cat for  miles around." She looked about on all sides, on the ground and in the  tree-tops. And there was no cat anywhere in sight.
