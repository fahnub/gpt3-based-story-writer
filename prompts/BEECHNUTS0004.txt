Outline: Down the hill from Farmer Green's house, a great beech tree stands beside the road. In the fall, when the nuts are ripe, Johnnie Green, Frisky Squirrel, and Jasper Jay all visit the tree to eat the beechnuts. They all think of the tree as theirs, and nobody else's.

One day in the fall, Grunty Pig wanders down the road and smells the beechnuts. He begins to search for them among the fallen leaves and finds a cluster of them inside a bur that the frost has split open. He eats the sweet nuts, shells and all.

Frisky Squirrel sees him and scolds him, telling him that the beechnuts belong to him, Johnnie Green, and Jasper Jay. Grunty Pig doesn't care and continues to search for more beechnuts.

Jasper Jay arrives and also scolds Grunty Pig. Grunty Pig doesn't listen and continues to search for more beechnuts.

Story so far:  Grunty is upset because Jasper Jay is making her collect acorns, but she reluctantly agrees to do as he says. Grunty Pig finds some nuts that Johnnie Green missed, and wonders why nobody ever told him about the beech tree. Frisky Squirrel tells him it's because he's a pig.

In the fall, Johnnie Green, Frisky Squirrel, and Jasper Jay all visit a beech tree to eat the nuts. They each think that the tree belongs to them, and nobody else. One day, when Johnnie is in school, another nut-lover visits the tree. Mrs. Pig's son, Grunty, has been helping himself to beechnuts. Frisky Squirrel, who owns the beechnuts with Jasper Jay and Johnnie Green, scolds Grunty. Grunty grunts in response, leading Frisky to believe he didn't know the beechnuts belonged to them. Frisky pardons Grunty.

Last chunk: Mrs. Pig's son, I notice that you have helped yourself freely to  beechnuts."  "I've eaten all I could find," Grunty told Frisky with a grin.  "I don't hear any thanks," Frisky Squirrel remarked. "Don't you know  that these beechnuts belong to me and Jasper Jay and Johnnie Green?"  "Umph!"  "You did?" Frisky inquired.  "Umph!"  "Oh, you didn't!" Frisky exclaimed. "Then I suppose I shall have to  pardon you. But Jasper Jay wouldn't, if he caught you taking any of the  nuts that fall from this
