Outline: A boy is sent to market by his mother to sell butter and cheese, but he is too lazy to do so and instead lies down by the river to wait for it to run out. His mother scolds him when he returns home empty-handed, telling him that he will never sell his wares if he continues to wait for the impossible.

Story so far:  A boy was sent to market to sell butter and cheese, but stopped by the river on the way and fell asleep. When he woke up, all his goods were gone, and he had to go home empty-handed. A mother scolds her son for not selling his butter and cheese, telling him that he will never sell them if he waits for the river to run out.

Last chunk: you  have  sold  nothing  all  day?"  "Why,  Mother,  yonder  is  a  river  that  has  been  running  all  this  day,  and    I  stayed  till  just  now,  waiting  for  it  to  run  out;  and  there  it  is,    running  still."  "My  Son,"  said  the  good  woman,  "thy  head  and  mine  will  be  laid  in  the    grave  many  a  day  before  this  river  has  all  run  by.    You  will  never  sell    your  butter  and  cheese  if  you  wait  for  that."
