Outline: The story follows a group of sheep who get mixed up and start going in different directions. Snowball Lamb ends up face-to-face with Aunt Nancy Ewe, who is so big he can't budge her.

Snowball falls into the raspberry bushes and thinks for sure the bear is going to eat him. However, the bear ends up being scared off by the other sheep and Snowball is left unharmed. Aunt Nancy is not pleased with Snowball when she sees him again and she scolds him for getting them all into a mix-up.
