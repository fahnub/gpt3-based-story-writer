Outline: Benny Badger is out walking one night when he comes across Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox is a wily gentleman, and Benny Badger is immediately suspicious of him.

Benny Badger asks Mr. Fox what he is up to, and Mr. Fox claims he is just out for a walk. Benny Badger doesn't believe him, and so he decides to follow him.

Sure enough, Mr. Fox soon comes across a bird's nest. He tries to take the eggs, but he is so clumsy that he makes a lot of noise and wakes up the mother bird. The bird starts to attack Mr. Fox, and Benny Badger comes to his rescue.

Benny Badger scolds Mr. Fox for trying to rob the bird's nest and then starts to drag him away. Mr. Fox begs Benny Badger to let him go, and Benny finally agrees.

As Mr. Fox is running away, he laughs and tells Benny Badger that he would have tried to rob the nest himself if he hadn't been so clumsy. Benny is surprised by this, and it makes him think.

The story ends with Benny Badger realizing that he is not really any better than Mr. Fox, and that maybe he should try to be more like him.

Story so far:  Benny Badger goes back to the place where he saw Mr. Fox, but he is nowhere to be found. Benny then asks other animals if they have seen Mr. Fox, but all of them point in different directions. Benny Badger finds an egg on Mr. Fox's mouth and tries to rub it off. Benny Badger noticed that Mr. Fox was in three different places and decided to look in a fourth direction because he felt that Mr. Fox was a roving fellow. Benny Badger tries to teach Mr. Fox a lesson by shaking him, but Mr. Fox is unperturbed and just asks Benny to take his teeth off his neck. Benny Badger finds Mr. Fox and asks him what happened to the eggs. Mr. Fox looks uncomfortable and Benny deduces that he ate them. Mr. Fox tricks Benny Badger into thinking he is no better than Mr. Fox himself.

Last chunk: to laugh.  "Why, you'd rob them yourself if you weren't so clumsy!" he cried."You're really no better than I am."  Benny Badger hadn't thought of that. And the idea surprised him so muchthat his mouth fell open. And of course Mr. Fox at once leaped aside andran off.
