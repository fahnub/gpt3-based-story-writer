Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A competition is underway to win a silver arrow. Ben and Bab are two of the best marksmen, but when the old lady catches Ben's jacket and begins questioning him, it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard. The monkey is freed from his uniform and given food by the young master. Ben is a dog who loves to explore and have fun. He is always up for a game of fetch or a good belly rub.

Last chunk: frisking  about Ben at the risk of getting his tail chopped off, then trotting  away to poke his inquisitive nose into every closet and room whither he  followed Mrs. Moss in her "flying round" evolutions; next dragging off  the mat so Betty could brush the door-steps, or inspecting Bab's  dish-washing by standing on his hind-legs to survey the table with a  critical air. When they drove him out he was not the least offended, but  gayly barked Puss up a tree, chased all the hens over the fence,
