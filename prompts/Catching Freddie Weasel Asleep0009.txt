Last chunk: dashed  into the bushes. He was not afraid of Frisky Squirrel. But Henry Skunk  was altogether too big. Freddie did not enjoy fighting _him_.  Well! Frisky, with his aching shoulder, and Henry Skunk, with his sore  nose, went off together. They didn't say a word to each other, until  they reached the hickory tree where Frisky lived. And then all they  said was "Good-night!"  Frisky never spied on anybody again. He had learned that it is better  not to meddle in other people's private affairs.
