Outline: Buster Bumblebee is a lazy bee who is content to lounge around and do nothing all day. One day, he is visited by his sister, the trumpeter, who informs him that he is a queen's son and a gentleman. Buster is surprised and shocked to learn that his sister is a member of the royal family. However, he is soon convinced that it is better for him to play the role of the gentleman than to try to work like the other bees. The trumpeter agrees to help Buster by stuffing his ears with cotton so that he can sleep through the morning trumpet resounding through the fields.

Story so far:  Buster Bumblebee meets a trumpeter who tells him she is also a queen's daughter. They laugh at each other's mistakes and become friends. The passage describes a bee gathering nectar and forgetting about a problem with a bumblebee. The bumblebee then talks to a trumpeter and feels better, expecting to be able to sleep in. The passage tells the story of Buster Bumblebee, who is surprised to learn that the trumpeter who wakes him up each morning is actually his sister. The trumpeter's sister tells her that it's probably better for her to just play the gentleman, since she's so clumsy. Buster responds that he doesn't mind, but he wishes she could find a way to wake up the workers in the morning without disturbing him. The trumpeter thinks for a bit before replying that it's her duty to trumpet loudly, since summer is short. The rabbit is fleeing from a fire, but pauses to think when he realizes he has no idea where to find any cotton to extinguish the flames.

Last chunk: cotton that he needed. But he soon paused in his rapid flight and sat  down on a sprig of honeysuckle, to think.  He was puzzled. He hadn't the slightest idea where he could find any  cotton. So what was the use of hurrying, if he didn't know where he was  going?
