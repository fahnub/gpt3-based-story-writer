Outline: Trot is dreaming that she is at home in her bed, but she is cold and unable to move. She realizes that she is frozen inside of a block of ice and wakes up. She sees that the mermaid queen, Aquareine, is also frozen and realizes that their enemy, Zog, has frozen them while they slept. Trot decides that the only way to escape is to wait for the queen to melt the ice around them. The queen does so and they are able to swim to Cap'n Bill's room. They find that he is almost frozen and they have to rub him to bring him back to life. The queen and Clia decide that they need to leave the castle and they swim for the opening in the dome.
