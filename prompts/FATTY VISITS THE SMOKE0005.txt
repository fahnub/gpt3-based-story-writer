Outline: Fatty Coon is a raccoon who is very thin after a long winter of sleeping. He decides to go to Farmer Green's house to see if he can find anything to eat. He smells something delicious coming from a small, low building and goes inside. He finds a row of hams hung up to smoke and starts to eat one. Suddenly, he is thrown to the ground and the ham falls on top of him. He is very frightened and runs all the way home. He later realizes that he had simply bitten through the cord that was holding the ham up, and it fell on him when he tried to take a bite. His children love hearing the story of his adventure.

Story so far:  Fatty would have eaten an elephant if he had the chance. He was very excited to find a ham and ate it quickly.

Last chunk: would have tried to eat an elephant, if he had had the chance.  Fatty did not stop to look long at that row of hams. He climbed a post  that ran up the side of the house and he crept out along the pole from  which the hams were hung.  He stopped at the very first ham he came to. There was no sense in going  any further. And Fatty dropped on top of the ham and in a twinkling he  had torn off a big, delicious mouthful.  Fatty could not eat fast enough. He wished he had two mouths--he was so
