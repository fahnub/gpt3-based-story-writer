Story so far: The animals are planning to kill the wolf-child Mowgli, but one of them, Buldeo, killed a buffalo after mistaking it for the Devil-child. The village plans to torture and burn Messua and her husband for being the child's parents. The animals all agree to go ahead with the plan to destroy the fields of humans. Mowgli knows that the villagers will soon become dangerous, and that Buldeo will be coming in. Mowgli tells Gray Brother to sing to the charcoal-burners so they will not reach the village until it is dark. The speaker is asking if the person they're talking to heard them singing as they went through the jungle. They mention that they were just out "wooing" and ask if the other person liked the song. They then say that they don't want any of the "Man-Pack" to leave the gates tonight, before asking why they would need the Four if they're just going to kill something. Mowgli has a "Master-word" for the elephant Hathi, which will make him come to Mowgli. Bagheera is interested to hear this word, and goes to ask Mowgli for it. A hunter tells a group of wolves about a Brahmin's charm against a sorcerer's child, and how he would deal with such a creature. Mowgli translates the story for the wolves, but the witch part is beyond him. Hathi, the elephant, arrives to speak with Bagheera, the panther. He is nervous and his sons follow behind him.

Last chunk: arrived, in their usual way, without a  sound. The mud of the river was still fresh on their flanks, and Hathi  was thoughtfully chewing the green stem of a young plantain-tree that he  had gouged up with his tusks. But every line in his vast body showed to  Bagheera, who could see things when he came across them, that it was not  the Master of the Jungle speaking to a Man-cub, but one who was afraid  coming before one who was not. His three sons rolled side by side,  behind their father.
