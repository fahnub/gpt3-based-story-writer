Outline: Rusty Wren's wife is still shaken up after being frightened by Jasper Jay dropping cherries on her house. Rusty takes it upon himself to find food for their six children, and he works tirelessly to do so. However, as the children grow, they need more and more food, and Rusty realizes he won't be able to keep up. He comes up with the idea to get somebody to help him, and his wife reluctantly agrees. Rusty hangs a sign that says "Boy Wanted" and soon enough, a young bird named Freddy Finch comes along and applies for the job. Freddy is a hard worker and a quick learner, and Rusty's wife soon warms up to him. The family is doing well until one day, Freddy doesn't come home from work. Rusty and his wife worry all night, and the next day they set out to find Freddy. They eventually find him lying on the ground, sick and injured. They take him back to their home and nurse him back to health, and Freddy is soon part of the family for good.

Story so far:  Rusty's wife does not want to stay alone in the house at night with six small children, so Rusty plans to get somebody to help him.

Last chunk: home and catch their own  insects," Rusty told her hopefully. "And until that time comes I'll  manage somehow, even if I have to work after dark."  But that plan did not suit his wife at all.  "I shouldn't care to stay alone in the house at night with six  small children," she said. "That will never do."  "I have it!" Rusty cried suddenly. "I'll get somebody to help me!"  Well, his wife didn't think much of that plan, either.  "I don't like the idea of any strange bird coming into my house,"
