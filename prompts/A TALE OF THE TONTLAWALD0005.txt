Story so far: A girl is transported to a magical forest called the Tontlawald, where she meets a kind woman who offers to send her home. A rock opens and a table with food appears when a cock crows. More furniture and fruit appear when the cock crows again. When everybody is done, the old man strikes the rock and everything disappears. A girl invites another to come play with her and her mother in the woods, promising fun and safety. The other girl is amazed by the beauty of the woods and the abundance of fruit. A black cat runs up to a rock in the middle of a block, and a dish appears on the other side of the rock. The old man picks up the dish and the cat, and they all vanish into the rock. A young girl begs a woman to let her stay with her, saying that her stepmother beats her and she can't do anything right. The woman agrees to let her stay. A woodcutter was chopping down a tree when he suddenly hit something that bled and screamed. He ran away in terror, and no one would go near the tree again. A peasant in a nearby village had recently married a young wife who was causing a lot of trouble.

Last chunk: axe into a tree, but his blow was followed by a stream of blood and shrieks as of a human creature in pain.

As not uncommonly happens in such cases, she turned the whole house upside down, and the two quarrelled and fought all day
