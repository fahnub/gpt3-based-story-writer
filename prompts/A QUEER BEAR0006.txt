Outline: Grunty Pig tells his mother he saw a bear, but she does not believe him. She punishes him for lying, but the next day he runs away again and is warned by the Muley Cow about bears. He does not believe her and stays in the pasture, but when it gets dark he is scared and goes home.

Story so far:  Grunty Pig is punished for running away and telling fibs, but he cannot resist the call of the fields and slips away again. Grunty Pig tells his mother that the bear that chased him was whitish with brown spots, had a long tail, and six legs. Mrs. Pig makes a strange noise, and Grunty Pig realizes that he described a dog, not a bear. The woman in the passage thinks that the man will change his tune when it gets dark.

Last chunk: said nothing more to him. She merely looked at him and  smiled wisely.  "He'll sing a different song," she thought, "when it begins to grow  dark."
