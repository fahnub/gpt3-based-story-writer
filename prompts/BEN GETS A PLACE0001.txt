Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A young boy has encounters with different animals and impresses those around him, but the Muley Cow is unhappy with him for being too nice to Twinkleheels.

Last chunk: BEN GETS A PLACE (Fiction:- Ages 5 to 10)  When Ben awoke next morning, he looked about him for a moment half  bewildered, because there was neither a canvas tent, a barn roof, nor  the blue sky above him, but a neat white ceiling, where several flies  buzzed sociably together, while from without came, not the tramping of  horses, the twitter of swallows, or the chirp of early birds, but the  comfortable cackle of hens and the sound of two little voices chanting  the multiplication table.
