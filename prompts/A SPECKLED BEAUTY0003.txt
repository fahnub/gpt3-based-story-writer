Outline: Henrietta Hen is a self-proclaimed "speckled beauty" who is very proud of her accomplishments, no matter how small. She is always boasting about how she is the best at everything, and she gets very angry if anyone suggests otherwise. Henrietta is especially proud of her eggs, and she loves to tell everyone about her latest laying.

One day, Henrietta is bragging to Polly Plymouth Rock about her eggs when Polly points out that Henrietta doesn't even know how to make an omelette. This shuts Henrietta up for once, and she goes home feeling embarrassed.

Story so far:  This passage describes Henrietta Hen, who is known for being very noisy. Sometimes, when she goes around asking people if they've heard the latest news, she gets snubbed. Henrietta Hen always has a lot to say, regardless of whether anyone is around to listen. She prefers to have an audience for her remarks, but will talk just as much even if she's alone.

Last chunk: She had never been off the  farm. But it was useless to remind her that she had never travelled. Such  a remark only made her angry.  Having such a good opinion of herself, Henrietta Hen always had a great  deal to talk about. She kept up a constant cluck from dawn till dusk. It  made no difference to her whether she happened to be alone, or with  friends. She talked just the same--though naturally she preferred to have  others hear what she said, because she considered her remarks most
