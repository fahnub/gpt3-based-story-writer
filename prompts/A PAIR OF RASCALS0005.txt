Outline: Mr. Frog is a tailor who lives by a creek. One day, he sees Mr. Crow flying overhead and calls out to him. Mr. Crow is on his way to the cornfield and doesn't want to stop, but Mr. Frog insists that he has important news.

Mr. Frog tells Mr. Crow that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler and that's how he makes his famous "Katy did, Katy" song. Mr. Crow is unimpressed and tells Mr. Frog that he won't be spreading this news around.

Mr. Frog is disappointed but Mr. Crow is unmoved. He tells Mr. Frog that he's not going to tell Brownie Beaver about the news either, because they've had a disagreement. Mr. Crow flies off to the cornfield and Mr. Frog is left alone.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow is wise and knows that Mr. Frog is not to be trusted. He decides to spread news about Pleasant Valley in his own way, without thanking Mr. Frog. Mr. Frog is disappointed but does not blame himself. The narrator's grandfather told him a secret, but only after he had eaten breakfast. The grandfather may have been in a better mood if the secret had been shared earlier. Mr. Frog is waiting for Mr. Crow to arrive so he can tell him some news. Mr. Frog tells Mr. Crow that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler who plays every night. Mr. Crow is hungry and tells Mr. Frog to talk fast. The sprightly tailor tells Mr. Crow that he has made another suit for somebody and Mr. Crow says that he cannot put that news in his cornfield. The tailor tells Mr. Crow that the reason the frogs keep croaking "Katy did, Katy" all night is because a young frog is courting his daughter. Mr. Crow is horrified at this news and vows not to tell Brownie Beaver about it.

Last chunk: And that's the way he makes that ditty of his--_Katy did,  Katy_----"  "Don't!" Mr. Crow begged. "Please don't! It's bad enough to have to hear  that silly chorus every time I happen to wake up during the night--bad  enough, I say, without being obliged to listen to it in broad daylight."  "Very well!" the tailor yielded. "But he fiddles it, all the same. And  when you tell my tale to Brownie Beaver I guess he'll be surprised."  "I shan't tell him," Mr. Crow declared, thereby astonishing Mr.
