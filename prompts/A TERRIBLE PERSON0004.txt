Outline: The rats and mice on the farm think that Miss Kitty Cat is a terrible person because she loves to hunt them. However, they also think it's pleasant to have her around because she can predict the weather. When old dog Spot chases her, she can be quite fierce. But around the farmhouse, she is always polite and never makes a fuss.

Johnnie Green likes Miss Kitty and often pets her. If he were her size and she were his, she might play with him like she does with a mouse. But Johnnie Green never stops to think of anything like that.

Story so far:  Miss Kitty was always polite and never caused any trouble, even though she might have been hungry or cold. Miss Kitty Cat is usually calm and collected, but when old dog Spot chases her, she can be quite ferocious. Miss Kitty Cat loves to hunt at night, and she is very stealthy and dangerous. Smaller animals know to stay out of her way.

Last chunk: And  there she would doze by the hour--especially after she had enjoyed a  hearty meal.  On summer nights, however, when she loved to hunt out of doors, Miss  Kitty Cat was far from appearing sleepy. She roamed about the fields, or  crept through the tree-tops with a stealthy tread and a tigerish working  of her tail. Folk smaller than Miss Kitty never cared to meet her at  such times. They knew that she would spring upon them if she had a  chance. So they took good care to keep out of her way.
