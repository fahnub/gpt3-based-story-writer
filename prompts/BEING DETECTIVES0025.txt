Story so far:  Oswald and Dicky try to look through a hole in a flower pot on a window ledge to see coiners, but they don't see anything. The passage describes a boy named Albert who is waiting for a train with his uncle. His uncle tells him that the books he is reading are poorly translated and written in bad English. Albert disagrees, saying that they are still good stories. Alice is unconvinced by the justification for capital punishment, saying that she would be more interested in being a detective who catches criminals than in being a murderer herself. Alice's hero tries to retrieve something from a flower pot, but falls and hits his head on an iron pillar, rendering himself unconscious. The passage describes how the gate at the end of the next garden opened, and Dicky nudged Alice so that she would have fallen out of the tree if it had not been for Oswald's extraordinary presence of mind. Someone taps on the back door, and is let in. A light appears in the window of the downstairs breakfast room, but the shutters are up. Dicky is excited, but Alice is scared. The narrator thinks they should leave and come back with a stronger force. Alice says it's not burglars.

Indeed, I thought myself at first that perhaps  it would be better to retire for the present, and return later with a  strongly armed force.  'It's not burglars,' Alice
