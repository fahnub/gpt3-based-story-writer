Outline: Peter Mink is angry with Tommy Fox for showing everyone that Peter is afraid of Fatty Coon. Peter Mink tells everyone he meets how he is going to punish Tommy Fox. Jimmy Rabbit inquires what he is going to do and Peter Mink replies that he is going to bite his nose. Slim Mink, Peter's cousin, is spending the summer near the duck pond and begins to worry that if Peter does to Tommy Fox half the things he says he is going to do, he will be sent to the Reform School. Slim Mink tells Peter Mink to let the young fox alone and that he fights too much. Peter Mink tells Slim Mink to hold his tongue and threatens to bite his nose. Slim Mink and Peter Mink go down to the brook to fish but Slim Mink decides not to. They roam through the woods and at last find Tommy Fox at a garden-party given by Jimmy Rabbit. Everybody but Tommy Fox is having refreshments. Peter Mink marches up to Tommy Fox and bites him on the nose. There is an uproar and Tommy Fox and Peter Mink roll over and over upon the ground. After a while they stop and Peter Mink is a sad sight. Tommy Fox won the fight and to everybody's surprise, the gladdest of all is Slim Mink, Peter's cousin.

Slim has heard that there is a Reform School where boys are sent who fight too much, and he is afraid that if Peter does to Tommy Fox half the things he says he is going to do, he will be caught and sent there. Everyone is happy that Tommy Fox won the fight against Peter Mink, including Slim Mink, who is Peter's cousin.

Last chunk: worse. And one of his eyes was  closed. And he had lost his hat, and one shoe.  Everyone was glad that the trouble was over. And everyone was glad that  Tommy Fox had won.  And to everybody's surprise, the gladdest of all was Slim Mink, Peter's  cousin.  "Hurrah!" he cried. (The others had been too polite to say anything.)  "What makes you shout that?"
