Outline: The story is set in a monastery, where the monks live a life of prayer and contemplation. One day, they decide to choose a beggar from the outside world to be their porter, in order to keep the 'evil' of the world from entering their holy place. The porter faithfully does his job, keeping out all who would disturb the peace of the monastery.

However, one Easter Eve, the porter allows a sick old man and other needy individuals into the monastery, saying that it is the will of God. The monks are forced to put aside their prayer and contemplation to tend to the needs of these people. They are surprised to find that, in doing so, they are fulfilling their prayers more than ever before.

The story ends with the old abbot feeling the beat of wings, knowing that his time has come to meet his Master in heaven.

This passage describes a monastery that is pure and beautiful, with strong walls and holy men.

The speaker says that he has healed the woodland creatures and now needs to leave. The speaker has kept the Abbot's gate this Easter Eve and now the Abbot's house shines like a star to show the Angels where God's children are. This passage discusses how the prayers of the righteous are sometimes drowned out by the cries of those who are suffering from injustice. However, when true love is shed on those who are suffering, their cries are transformed into something that is heard and welcomed in heaven. This passage describes how the monks blossomed when they were left undisturbed, but when the beggar-porter died, they had to face the outside world again.

When they had covered up the foolish head,    And on the foolish loving heart heaped clay,    "Which of us, brothers, now," the Abbot said,    "Will face the world, to keep the world away?"    But
