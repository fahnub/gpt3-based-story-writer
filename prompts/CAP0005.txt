Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of Cap'n Bill, a fish-like man with a wooden leg, and his adventures under water. He meets up with Cap'n Joe, who is also under water, and together they try to move a stepladder. Brownie Beaver is also introduced, who is stuck under a tree trunk. A woman enters a room and comments on how pretty it is, noting that it is owned by the "awful creature" Zog. The sailor says that he once heard of a people who sacrificed humans to their gods, but before doing so, they stuffed them with food and dressed them in pretty clothes.

Last chunk: dear friend was located. She  entered from the doorway that connected the two rooms and said,  "Isn't it pretty, Cap'n? And who'd ever think that awful creature  Zog owned such a splendid castle and kept his prisoners in such  lovely rooms?"  "I once heard tell," said the sailor, "of a foreign people that  sacrificed humans to please their pagan gods, an' before they killed  'em outright they stuffed the victims full of good things to eat an'  dressed 'em in pretty clothes an' treated 'em like
