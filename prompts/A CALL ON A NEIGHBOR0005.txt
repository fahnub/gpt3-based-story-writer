Outline: Daddy Longlegs is delighted to be home again and his neighbors remark that they have never seen him so happy and cheerful. One reason for Daddy's good spirits is the fact that the wind no longer blows and he can venture abroad without being buffeted about.

 Daddy Longlegs is so relieved by the change in the weather that it seems to him there could be no danger anywhere and he begins to feel quite important. His friends rush to the stone wall to talk with him and he begins to boast about his wild ride in Farmer Green's wagon.

"And besides, I'd like to hear about his cousin's party, which I missed  on account of the big wind." So off Daddy Longlegs started, the moment  the idea popped into his head.
