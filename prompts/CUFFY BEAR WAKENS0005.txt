Outline: Nimble, a deer, is out foraging for food when he happens upon the cave where he had waited for Cuffy Bear weeks before. He remembers how he had fed upon the green things under the snow and begins to paw away the snow to find more food.

Cuffy Bear, who had been inside the cave sleeping, wakes up and comes out to find Nimble. At first, Cuffy doesn't recognize Nimble because he has shed his horns since they last met. But once Cuffy realizes who Nimble is, he is surprised to see him because he had assumed Nimble would have left long ago.

Nimble says he's not going to wait, and trots off in the direction of Cedar Swamp. Nimble Deer tells Cuffy Bear that he has been asleep in the den all winter and only woke up because he heard Spot barking. Cuffy Bear is surprised and can't say anything.

It's weeks and weeks since I last saw you. And I'm here now only because  I happened to wander this way, when I heard old dog Spot baying."
