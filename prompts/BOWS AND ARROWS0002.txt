Story so far: The passage tells the story of two young girls who want to become better archers. Thorny quickly improves but gets tired easily, while Bab is enthusiastic but not as skilled. Miss Celia suggests they make bows and arrows for the boys to use, but Betty is reluctant because she thinks it will be too much work. The passage also tells the story of a boy named Thorny who enjoys practicing archery. His sister mocks him, but he manages to shoot his arrow very high. The passage describes a time when the Indians came down the river and burned the houses, killed the men, and took the women and children away. Matty's father was always nearby, so she felt safe in their log house. However, one afternoon the bell rang, signaling danger, and the men had to hurry home to save their families. Kilburn ran toward the fort with his gun and daughter, but saw red men coming and knew he wouldn't make it in time. He looked for a safe place to hide Matty until he could come back for her. Thorny took turns to tell the few tragical facts which were not shrouded in the deepest mystery. If the interesting sufferer could only have spoken, what thrilling adventures and hair-breadth escapes he might have related. But, alas! he was dumb; and the secrets of that memorable month never were revealed. The lame paw soon healed, the dingy color slowly yielded to many washings, the woolly coat began to knot up into little curls, a new collar, handsomely marked, made him a respectable.
