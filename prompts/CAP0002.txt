Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

Story so far: The old sailor man trips on his wooden leg and nearly falls, but manages to catch himself and stand up again. Trot laughs at his antics. The passage describes a room with portraits of sea animals, mirrors on some of the walls, and peony-shaped furniture. There is also a bell cord that Cap'n Bill doesn't know is a bell cord. The speaker claims to have been turned into a fish by a sorcerer named Zog, and says that if he were to step on dry land, he would die. Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill are both skeptical, but don't press the issue. A child asks a slave if he can help them escape from the magician's cave, and the slave says that he will try, but that another slave, Sacho, is the best person to help them. Groo, the goldworker, has promised Cap'n Bill a gold leg that will stay down, but he never has time to make it. Cap'n Joe tells him that he's lucky to have a merman's tail instead. Cap'n Bill says he's not sure he would like this sort of thing always. The passage describes a room in a castle that has been furnished with items plundered from sunken ships. The room is cozy and interesting, with pictures on the walls.

Last chunk: of mother of pearl and the  cushions of soft, white sponges. In the room were toilet tables,  mirrors, ornaments and many articles used by earth people, which  they afterward learned had been plundered by Zog from sunken ships  and brought to his castle by his allies, the sea devils.  While the mermaids were examining and admiring their room, Cap'n  Bill went to the Peony Room to see what it was like and found his  quarters were very cozy and interesting. There were pictures on the  wall,
