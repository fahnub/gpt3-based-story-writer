Outline: The story takes place on a summer morning at a farmhouse in Prince  Edward Island. The farm belongs to Uncle Roger, and the house is full of  children: the narrator and his twin brother Felix, their cousins Dan and  Peter, and the orphaned Story Girl. Also staying with them are  relatives from out of town: Mrs. Patterson and her daughter, and Mrs.  Frewen and her sister, both with young daughters.

The children are in the kitchen, helping with the baking, when they're  joined by Felicity, who overslept herself. The Story Girl has already  baked the bread for the day, but Felicity is dismayed to discover that  she didn't let it rise a second time before putting it in the oven. The  bread is heavy and dense as a result.

The children are sent out to play while Felicity finishes the baking. They  discuss the Story Girl's mistake, and Felix tries to console her by  saying that everyone makes mistakes.

Later, company arrives: first Mrs. Patterson's sister and her family,  then some people from the town of Markdale, and finally Mrs. Frewen and  her sister from Vancouver. After tea, Mrs. Frewen and her sister want to  go to the Carlisle churchyard to visit their father's grave, and Dan  volunteers to stay home with Jimmy Patterson, the two-year-old son of  Mrs. Patterson, who has fallen asleep on the kitchen sofa.

The others go to the graveyard, leaving Dan sitting on the door-step  reading a book. When they return, Jimmy is nowhere to be found. They  search the house and yard, but he's nowhere to be found. They're  getting frantic when they finally discover him asleep under the sofa.

Everyone is relieved, but Dan is the hero of the day. The Story Girl is  a little jealous of Felicity, who received all the compliments during  tea. Cecily asks what "it never rains but it pours" means, and the  Story Girl explains that it means if anything happens, something else is  sure to happen.

Story so far: The passage describes a search for a missing child, during which the child's mother becomes hysterical. The search ends unsuccessfully. Dan and Felicity argue over whether a baby could have crawled out of a door. The passage describes a group of children searching for their friend Jimmy, who has disappeared. They look everywhere but cannot find him. Uncle Roger finds Jimmy Patterson asleep and is surprised. Dan triumphantly says he knew Jimmy never left the house. Felicity sets a batch of bread and the rest of them eat cherries and shoot the stones at each other. Cecily is questing for information and asks what "it never rains but it pours" means. This passage is about how some people believe that doing something for a long time makes it more likely that others will do it too. We left Dan sitting on the door-sill reading his book, and Jimmy P. snoozing blissfully on the sofa. When we returned, Dan was still sitting in precisely the same spot. Dan and Felicity are sitting in the same place, but they can't find Jimmy. Felicity accuses Dan of being too deep in his book to notice, but Dan insists he was right across the door the whole time.

Last chunk: the same place and attitude; but there was no Jimmy in sight.  "Dan, where's the baby?" cried Felicity.  Dan looked around. His jaw fell in blank amazement. I never saw any one  look as foolish as Dan at that moment.  "Good gracious, I don't know," he said helplessly.  "You've been so deep in that wretched book that he's got out, and dear  knows where he is," cried Felicity distractedly.  "I wasn't," cried Dan. "He MUST be in the house. I've been sitting right  across the door ever since you
