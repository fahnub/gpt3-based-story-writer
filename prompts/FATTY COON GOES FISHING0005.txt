Outline: Fatty Coon is strolling by a brook near his home when he sees a bright yellow and red bug land on the water. He reaches out to grab it, and is surprised when he finds himself being pulled into the water by the bug. He realizes there is a line attached to the bug, and at the other end of the line is a man - Farmer Green.

Farmer Green is just as surprised as Fatty Coon, and he starts to laugh when he realizes he almost caught a coon in his trout net. Fatty Coon is not amused, and he swims to the shore and runs into the bushes. He is relieved when the bug flies out of his mouth and takes the line with it. His mouth is sore from the fishhook, but he is otherwise unharmed. He learns his lesson and decides to stick to fishing for fish, not bugs.

Story so far:  Farmer Green was fishing in the brook and Fatty Coon reached out and grabbed the make-believe fly on the end of his line.

Last chunk: really happened. Farmer Green had come up the brook  to catch trout. On the end of his fish-line he had tied a make-believe  fly, with a hook hidden under its red and yellow wings. He had stolen  along the brook very quietly, so that he wouldn't frighten the fish. And  he had made so little noise that Fatty Coon never heard him at all.  Farmer Green had not seen Fatty, crouched as he was among the stones.  And when Fatty reached out and grabbed the make-believe fly Farmer Green  was even more
