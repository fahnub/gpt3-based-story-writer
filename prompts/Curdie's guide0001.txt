Outline: Curdie's mother finds the princess sleeping in her chair by the fire and Curdie is surprised to see her. The princess tells him she came because she thought he was in trouble and she wanted to help him. Curdie explains that the cobs have been into her house and into her bedroom, looking for her to take her back to the mountain as a wife for their prince Harelip. The princess is horrified at this and Curdie's mother tells him he must take her home. Curdie explains that he must go and wake his father first. He rushes off to do so and then returns to the cottage to eat breakfast. After breakfast, he tells his mother she must take the princess home herself and he sets off to the mountain to warn his people of the cobs.

Story so far:  The passage describes how Curdie found the princess's thread and realized that she must be nearby.
