Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Last chunk: can all start off at  once," said Mrs. Moss, as the last mouthful vanished, and Sancho licked  his lips over the savory scraps that fell to his share.  Ben fell to chopping so vigorously that chips flew wildly all about the  shed; Bab rattled the cups into her dish-pan with dangerous haste, and  Betty raised a cloud of dust "sweeping-up;" while mother seemed to be  everywhere at once. Even Sanch, feeling that his fate was at stake,  endeavored to help in his own somewhat erratic way,--now
