Outline: In the story, Dickie Deer Mouse and Fatty Coon are foraging for food in the woods. At this time of year, the deer shed their horns, which the Deer Mouse family feast on. However, Fatty Coon is not aware that the season for finding horns is over, and he sets out to find some.

 Dickie Deer Mouse knows that if Fatty Coon keeps searching for horns, he will stay away from the cornfield - and away from old dog Spot, who Dickie warned him about. Sure enough, when dawn breaks, Fatty Coon is back, angry and empty-handed.

 Dickie tries to reason with Fatty, telling him that he should just eat all the corn he can while he has the chance. But Fatty is determined to go to the cornfield, and Dickie ends up going with him.

As they enter the cornfield, they are met by old Mr. Crow, who tells them they are in a dangerous place. Dickie Deer Mouse is polite and says that there should be enough corn for everyone, but Fatty Coon just stuffs his face full of the food.

Story so far: Dickie Deer Mouse and Fatty Coon are on their way to a cornfield when they are met by Old Mr. Crow. Mr. Crow warns them that the cornfield is dangerous, but Fatty Coon pays no attention. Dickie Deer Mouse has a dream in which Fatty Coon is angry with him and shouting. Dickie wakes up and realizes it was just a dream. Fatty is angry with Dickie for giving him advice that has kept him from eating. The old gentleman in the passage seems to be upset about something, and Dickie tries to console him by saying that there is enough corn for everyone. Mr. Crow is not placated, however, and argues that there is not enough corn to feed the entire world. Fatty Coon then offers to let Mr. Crow have all the deer horns he wants.

Last chunk: all the corn he wanted he was going back to the woods.  Noticing that the old gentleman seemed peevish about something, Dickie  said to him:  "There ought to be enough for all."  But still Mr. Crow looked glum.  "There's enough for them that don't care for much else," he muttered.  "But we can't feed the whole world on this corn, you know.... How would  you like it if I took to eating deer's horns--when they're in season, of  course?"  "You can have all the deer's horns you want," Fatty Coon
