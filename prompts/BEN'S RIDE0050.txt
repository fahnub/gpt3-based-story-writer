Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes a competition, a boy's abuse of animals, and a doctor's house visit. Ben is grateful for Thorny's friendship but feels sad because it comes so soon after another loss. The boys in the passage are disappointed to hear that their cousin was unable to find their lost dog. The owner of the black poodle they find says he bought the dog from a stranger and is also upset at the loss of the animal. The passage describes how Thorny is confident that Ben will win an archery competition against Bab, despite Bab having been taught by Celia. The passage describes a man named Thorny singing a ballad with great excitement, which causes his friends Lita and Ben to react with enthusiasm. The ballad is about a man named Roland, who is praised by the people for his good deeds.

Last chunk: excitement, Thorny mounted the  meal-chest, to thunder out that stirring ballad with such spirit that  Lita pricked up her ears and Ben gave a shrill "Hooray!" as the last  verse ended.     "And all I remember is friends flocking round,   As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground,   And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,   As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,   Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)   Was no more than his due who brought good news
