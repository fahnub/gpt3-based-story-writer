Outline: Ferdinand Frog meets a Great Blue Heron and is impressed by the size of his bill. The heron tells Ferdinand that he is moving into the area and Ferdinand is immediately worried that the heron will eat him. The heron reassures Ferdinand that he is not interested in eating frogs and the two become friends. Ferdinand is amazed by the heron's bill and says that it would be useful for making button-holes. The heron is amused by this comment and flies away.

Story so far: A vain bird is pleased when a frog compliments the length and sharpness of its bill, but is revealed to live beyond the Second Mountain. Miss Kitty Cat knows the way back to Farmer Green's place, although she couldn't tell you how she knows. The famous race between Grumpy Weasel and Jimmy Rabbit goes on and on, with Jimmy trying to lose the weasel by running through Pleasant Valley. Jimmy grows tired and stopped to rest, but Grumpy Weasel never stopped once. Ferdinand Frog is relieved to find out that the huge bird he encountered is not a grizzly bear, but is instead G. B. Heron. Miss Kitty Cat frightens some birds by sharpening her claws against a tree trunk, then sets off for Pleasant Valley. Mr. Crow gives Jimmy Rabbit some advice that makes the latter take heart, and then Jimmy Rabbit runs away as Grumpy Weasel comes racing along. Kitty jogs along the roads, sometimes jumping on top of stone walls to use as a highway. When she hears the sound of a wagon, she hides in the bushes until the road is clear again. Mr. Crow is worried about Jimmy Rabbit's safety and tells him to come back tomorrow to find out what to do about the race against Grumpy Weasel. Peter Mink, Grumpy's cousin, mocks them and Mr. Crow tells him to run along.

Last chunk: let you know to-morrow," Mr. Crow  muttered hoarsely. To tell the truth, he was alarmed himself. And he had  no idea what Jimmy Rabbit could do to save himself from Grumpy Weasel.  While they talked, Grumpy's cousin, Peter Mink, watched them slyly.  "Who do you think is going to win the race?" he jeered.  Mr. Crow did not even turn his head. He felt very uncomfortable. But he  tried to look unconcerned.  "Run along!" he said to Jimmy. "To-morrow I'll tell you what to do."  "To-morrow--" Jimmy
