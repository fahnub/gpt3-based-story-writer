Outline: Turkey Proudfoot and his brother Tom are turkeys who are forced to spend their Thanksgiving apart. Three days before the holiday, Tom is put in a pen on his farm. Turkey Proudfoot, who has been living on a neighboring farm, comes to visit him the night before Thanksgiving and finds out that he has been miscounting the days. They talk and eventually fall asleep. The next morning, they wake up and realize that it is Thanksgiving. They spend the day together and are thankful for each other's company.
