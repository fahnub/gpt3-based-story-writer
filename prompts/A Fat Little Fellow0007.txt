Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is a plump little mouse who lives in Farmer Green's meadow. He is friendly with some of the other animals in the meadow, such as Paddy Muskrat and Billy Woodchuck, and is on the lookout for others, such as Peter Mink and Tommy Fox.

The only time Master Meadow Mouse is ever known to lose his temper is when Farmer Green mows the meadow. Under the high grass, Master Meadow Mouse had been able to run about his well-beaten paths unseen by hawks, but with the grass cut and raked, leaving only naked stubble, he can't hide.

After haying, Master Meadow Mouse has to be more careful than ever. He knows that the hawks will scan the meadow many times a day in hopes of catching a glimpse of his reddish-brown back. Luckily, he succeeds in dodging them.

Story so far:  The passage describes the reaction of Mrs. Bobolink and Master Meadow Mouse to the mowing machine. Mrs. Bobolink thinks it is a shame that Farmer Green should break up a happy home like theirs, and Master Meadow Mouse remarks that it was very careless of Farmer Green. Mrs. Bobolink suggests that they move to Cedar Swamp, and Master Meadow Mouse agrees. This passage describes how animals in Pleasant Valley view Farmer Green's fatness. Many of the animals there are fat-loving and view him as a potential meal, while others simply find him pleasant and enjoy his company. Meadow Mouse is explaining that Farmer Green can't stop the grass from growing back, and after haying, Meadow Mouse has to be more careful than ever. Master Meadow Mouse was a plump, good-natured creature who lived in Farmer Green's meadow. He was liked by his friends for his good nature, and he never harmed anybody. Master Meadow Mouse is upset when Farmer Green mows the meadow, as it makes it easier for predators to spot him. He agrees with Bobby Bobolink's wife, who is also upset by the haying. Master Meadow Mouse learned to look out for enemies and managed to enjoy life in Farmer Green's meadow despite them. He usually found plenty of seeds to eat and liked to swim in Broad Brook. In winter, he made tunnels and a nest beneath the snow. This passage describes a man who seems to enjoy the danger that comes with living in a place where it snows a lot. He apparently finds it exciting and doesn't mind the cold.

Last chunk: snow had descended on Pleasant  Valley. Yet he never complained. He said that danger kept the days--and  nights too--from being dull.  [Illustration]      [Illustration]
