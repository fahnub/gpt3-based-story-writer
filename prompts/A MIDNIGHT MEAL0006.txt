Outline: Mr. and Mrs. Moses Mouse are looking for something to eat in the cellar of the farmhouse they live in. They are complaining about how there is less to eat since Miss Snooper came to live there. Mrs. Mouse finds a box of potatoes and calls her husband over. They eat the potatoes and are happy.

Story so far:  A mouse named Moses becomes fretful after eating a good meal, so his wife goes to check on him. Soon after, he hears her muffled voice coming from inside a box, telling him that she's found potatoes.

Last chunk: fretful after he had eaten a good meal. So her feet twinkled  across the cellar floor and she disappeared inside the box.  Not hearing anything from her, Moses Mouse soon grew more impatient than  ever.  "Well!" he sang out. "What luck!"  "Potatoes!" came his wife's muffled answer, out of a full mouth. "I  declare, I forgot to call you."
