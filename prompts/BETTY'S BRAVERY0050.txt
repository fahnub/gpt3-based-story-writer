Story so far: A woman is trying to win back her husband's affections, but is unsuccessful. She feels that only the return of her friend Sancho will be able to restore their broken friendship. A group of children are playing near a gate when they see a dog on the other side. One child tries to look at the dog, but is not interested when she sees that it is only an old dog. Another child tells her that the dog is mad and that Jud is getting his gun to shoot it. The dog is excited to see the boy and jumps out of the phaeton to greet him. The boy falls down. The speaker is planning to take a child on a journey, and is considering which one to take. He prefers Betty because she is well-behaved and will be content with her doll. Betty is overjoyed to find her lost dog, Sanch, and does not care about her disheveled appearance or the audience of boys. The dog falls asleep under a linen duster. Miss Betty approaches the house with the lemon, forgetting about Belinda and "Bluebeard." The passage describes a harness shop in town that the speaker plans to give to Ben on his birthday. Thorny laughs and says that if Ben were to put brown tops on his old boots and stick a cockade in his hat, he would be a happy fellow. The speaker says that those things are out of place in America and would be absurd in a small country place like this. Betty rushes into the yard to save her friend, who turns out to be a dog. The man cheerfully swings the woman onto his shoulder and marches away, whistling "Hail! the conquering hero comes." The dog follows behind them, and the cat brings up the rear, banging on a milk-pan with the egg-beater.

Last chunk: cheerily, as he swung Betty to his shoulder and  marched away whistling "Hail! the conquering hero comes," while Ben and  his Bow-wow followed arm-in-arm, and Bab brought up the rear, banging on  a milk-pan with the egg-beater.
