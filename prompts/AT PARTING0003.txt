Last chunk: loved its ways and walks and kept    The garden watered, and the pleasance swept.      Yet--if you must--go now:    Go, with my blessing filling both your hands,    And, mid the desert sands    Which life drifts deep round every garden wall,    Make your new festival    Of bud and blossom--red rose and green leaf.
