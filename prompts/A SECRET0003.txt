Outline: Miss Kitty Cat is trying to tell Farmer Green's wife something, but Mrs. Green is too busy to listen. Miss Kitty then tries to get Old Dog Spot to follow her, but he is too afraid of her after she scratches him in the barn. Miss Kitty goes off on her own and does something that only Mrs. Green would understand.

Story so far:  Old dog Spot offers to follow Miss Kitty to the barn, but she scorns him, saying she wouldn't take him where she's going or show him what she wants Mrs. Green to see. Miss Kitty is warning old Spot not to follow her, or she will make him regret it. This is reminiscent of when she first arrived at the farm and he tried to corner her in the barn - she scratched him up pretty badly. The passage describes a cat's relief at getting rid of a pesky woodchuck by sending it away to the pasture. The cat is free to do as it pleases without having to worry about the woodchuck getting in the way. Miss Kitty Cat was behaving strangely, coming into the kitchen and mewing as if she had something to tell Farmer Green's wife. Mrs. Green asked if she was hungry, but Kitty wouldn't touch anything she offered. Mrs. Green told her she would have to run away. Miss Kitty Cat wants to lead her mistress, Mrs. Green, somewhere, but Mrs. Green doesn't understand. Miss Kitty Cat is hurt because Mrs. Green is ignoring her.

Last chunk: she cried, just a bit impatiently. "I've too much to do to be  bothered this morning. I suppose you've caught a mouse and want to show  it to me. You'll have to bring it here, for I haven't any time to waste  to-day."  Miss Kitty Cat felt somewhat hurt. She went out and sat on the doorstep  and looked in at Farmer Green's wife. Now and then she gave a plaintive  mew. But Mrs. Green wouldn't pay any attention to her.  "Dear me!" said Miss Kitty. "Mrs. Green is busier than ever this  morning."
