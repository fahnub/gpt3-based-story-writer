Outline: Grandaddy Beaver and his friends go to visit Ferdinand Frog at the pond, but he is nowhere to be found. They discover a small building nearby and soon realize that it is where Ferdinand Frog lives. They hear a noise coming from the house and soon realize that it is Ferdinand Frog, who has been watching and listening to them the whole time. Ferdinand Frog is a tailor and offers to make clothes for them. They form a line to go into the house and Ferdinand Frog measures them. They are supposed to pass out the back way, but Ferdinand Frog makes a blunder and they all crowd out the front door.

Story so far:  The passage describes a building that nobody seems to know anything about. This passage describes how Mr. Frog is an odd fellow who has his sign painted on the inside of his door instead of the outside. People begin to exclaim that this is just like him to do something like this. Mr. Frog then replies that it will be all the style five years from now. It is revealed that Mr. Frog is a tailor himself and he is ready to make clothes for all of the animals. The passage describes people who are surprised to find a frog listening to their conversation. They invite the frog to come out and see them. Grandaddy Beaver and his village friends wait on a rock for Ferdinand Frog, who never shows up. A frog is measuring people as they come in through the front door and go out the back, but he gets overwhelmed and makes a mistake.

Last chunk: them!  It was almost too good to be true. But there he stood in the doorway,  with a tape around his neck, smiling and bowing.  "You'd better form in line!" he suggested. "You can come in through the  front door. I'll measure you. And you can pass out the back way. . . .  Don't crowd, please!"  Now, that was just where Mr. Frog made a great blunder. But he didn't  find it out till it was too late.
