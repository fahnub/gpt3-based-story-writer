Outline: Rusty Wren's cousin, Long Bill, is having a party tomorrow at his home near Black Creek and has sent old Mr. Crow to deliver the invitation. When Jolly Robin arrives with the message, Rusty is excited to attend but his wife is not pleased as it is a men's party. Rusty promises to help his wife with her house-cleaning tomorrow but is clearly eager to attend the party. His wife warns him that he will be busy at home. The next day, Rusty goes to the party while his wife stays home to clean.

Story so far:  Rusty's wife is upset about something, so he decides it is best if their visitor does not stay too long. Rusty says he is going to the orchard to hunt for insects and Mrs. Rusty tells him to remember that he has to be busy at home tomorrow. A woman tells a man that she won't be able to attend a party because her husband is helping her with housework. The man looks worried but doesn't say anything. Rusty Wren's cousin, Long Bill, lived in the reeds on the bank of Black Creek. Although everybody called him "Long Bill," like Rusty Wren he was actually short and chubby. His bill, however, was much longer than Rusty's. The speaker seems to be in a hurry to get to the orchard, which suggests that he may be trying to get away from home.
