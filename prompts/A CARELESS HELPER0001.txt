Outline: Benny Badger and Mr. Coyote are working together to try to catch a ground squirrel. They take turns digging tunnels and watching the back door of the squirrel's nest, but Mr. Coyote is not very successful at keeping watch. Benny gets frustrated and starts to dig all the tunnels himself while Mr. Coyote watches, but Mr. Coyote soon gets bored and falls asleep. Benny is angry and decides that he will have to find a new helper.

Story so far:  Mr. Coyote objects to Benny's plan and says he can't help because he has a sore paw. Benny is disappointed that Mr. Coyote is not as helpful as he expected in catching ground squirrels. He decides that he will have to take over the job of watching, while Mr. Coyote does the digging. Mr. Coyote is telling Benny Badger that he is getting sleepy and will be going home to take a nap. He tells Benny that he will be back to help him again after sunset. Benny Badger finds an abandoned ground squirrel nest that is still warm, and concludes that the squirrel must have left recently. He is not too disappointed, as he remembers that Mr. Coyote is watching.
