Outline: Fatty Coon has been warned by Mr. Crow that Farmer Green is going to set old dog Spot on him if he doesn't stay out of the cornfield. Fatty is reluctant to stay away from the cornfield because he loves corn, but he is even more afraid of being caught by the dog.

Dickie Deer Mouse tells Fatty that he has managed to stay away from the cornfield by focusing on something else that he loves - deer horns. Dickie explains that deer horns can be found in the woods, near the foot of a tree.

Fatty Coon is immediately eager to try this new method and begins searching for deer horns. He is soon successful in finding some, and Dickie Deer Mouse is happy to see that his advice has helped Fatty stay away from the cornfield.

Story so far:  Dickie Deer Mouse is telling Fatty Coon that deer horns make a good meal, and that he should be able to find some in the woods.

Last chunk: "What kind?" he asked his small friend.  "Deer's!" Dickie explained. "You know they drop them in the woods  sometimes. I've had many a meal off deer's horns. And I can say  truthfully that there's nothing quite like them when you're hungry."  Fatty Coon actually began to look hopeful.  "I'm always hungry," he announced. "And perhaps if I could get a taste  of deer's horns they would keep my mind off the cornfield. Where did  you say I could find some?"  "I didn't say," Dickie Deer Mouse reminded
