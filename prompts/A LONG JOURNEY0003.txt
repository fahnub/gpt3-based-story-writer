Outline: Ferdinand Frog meets a Great Blue Heron and is impressed by the size of his bill. The heron tells Ferdinand that he is moving into the area and Ferdinand is immediately worried that the heron will eat him. The heron reassures Ferdinand that he is not interested in eating frogs and the two become friends. Ferdinand is amazed by the heron's bill and says that it would be useful for making button-holes. The heron is amused by this comment and flies away.

Story so far: A vain bird is pleased when a frog compliments its bill, but lives far from the frog. Miss Kitty Cat knows the way back to her home, although she couldn't tell you how she knows. The famous race between Grumpy Weasel and Jimmy Rabbit goes on, with Jimmy trying to lose the weasel. Jimmy grows tired and stopped to rest, but Grumpy Weasel never stopped once. Ferdinand Frog is relieved to find out that the huge bird he encountered is not a grizzly bear, but is instead G. B. Heron. Miss Kitty Cat frightens some birds by sharpening her claws, then sets off for home. Mr. Crow gives Jimmy Rabbit some advice and Jimmy Rabbit runs away as Grumpy Weasel comes racing along. Kitty walks for three days and nights until she reaches her home. Ferdinand Frog is upset because he thinks he is too fat, but Mr. Heron tells him he looks good. Ferdinand is pleased and says that he has always been satisfied with himself until he saw Mr. Heron. Mr. Frog and Mr. Heron have a conversation in which Mr. Heron says he is moving to the area and Mr. Frog says he has a large family. Miss Kitty Cat, having just set out on a journey, stops to drink from a brook. She then becomes tempted to explore a wood nearby, where she sees many birds and chipmunks. Frog tells Mr. Heron that he has a few relatives, but they're not very important to him. Mr. Heron looks surprised and says that it's strange that Frog would feel that way. Miss Kitty Cat thinks about her breakfast and how at home Mrs. Green would be putting a saucer of milk on the woodshed steps. But she has to find something to eat herself and luckily finds a surprised meadow mouse. After breakfasting, she teases the birds who scold her and tell her to leave.

Last chunk: Miss Kitty Cat just naturally began to think of her own  breakfast.  "If I were at home, Mrs. Green would be setting a saucer of milk on the  woodshed steps about this time," she murmured. "But now I must shift for  myself."  Luckily Miss Kitty was quite able to find something to eat, as a  surprised meadow mouse soon discovered.  After breakfasting, Miss Kitty lingered a while to tease the birds, who  scolded her shrilly, calling her a tramp and telling her to get out of  their woods.  Of
