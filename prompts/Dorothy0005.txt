Outline: Dorothy, Betsy, and Ozma are watching a magic picture that changes scenes and shows events happening all over the world. They see Button-Bright in Jinxland, and Ozma is worried for him because it is a part of her dominions. Dorothy and Betsy decide to go on a journey to meet the Scarecrow and the strangers in Jinxland, and Ozma gives them the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon. On their journey, they have many adventures and meet new friends. They eventually make it to Glinda's palace, where they are welcomed.

Story so far: The passage describes the arrival of the Woggle-Bug and the Scarecrow's refusal to let him read his Ode to Ozma. Billina tells the Head Booleywag that she is glad her chicks have a parent, because they will have more fun worrying her than if they were raised in an Incubator. The passage also describes a girl who is lost and is being led by a man. They come across a boy who is digging a hole. Dorothy meets Button-Bright on a road that winds through green meadows and fields. The Emerald City of Oz is a beautiful and magnificent city that is the center of the Land of Oz. The palace of Ozma is surrounded by a wall of glistening emeralds and is almost a city in itself. The Scarecrow is saved from being burned up by the Orks, and Ozma asks the Wizard to prepare a place for the strangers to sleep. The shaggy man says that every road leads somewhere, so he and Dorothy will eventually find a place if they keep travelling. He doesn't know where they will end up, but they will find out when they get there. Dorothy agrees that the Shaggy Man's plan makes sense. Dorothy has breakfast with Polly and the shaggy man, and they are rejoined by Toto. They hear the sound of a brass band playing, which means that the guests Dorothy invited are arriving. The passage describes Dorothy, a girl who lives in a fairy-land and is thus accustomed to accepting strange things as normal. On occasion, she can be foolish or stubborn, but overall she is a likable character.

Last chunk: Billina the Yellow Hen, Eureka the Pink Kitten, and many other  delightful characters and creatures. Coming as she did from our world,  Dorothy was much like many other girls we know; so there were times  when she was not so wise as she might have been, and other times when  she was obstinate and got herself into trouble.
