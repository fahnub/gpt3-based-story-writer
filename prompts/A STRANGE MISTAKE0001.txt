Outline: Rusty Wren and Mr. Frog are on their way to a party at Rusty's cousin Long Bill Wren's house. When they arrive, they are surprised to see that there are no other guests and no signs of a party. Long Bill comes out and explains that there was a mix-up with the invitations and they are actually a year late. Rusty and Mr. Frog have a pleasant chat with Long Bill and then Rusty goes home. His wife is suspicious that he has been to a party and Rusty is indignant that she would think such a thing.

Story so far:  The passage describes a strange-looking house made out of coarse grasses and reeds, which is inhabited by Long Bill. Mr. Frog remarks that it's odd that Long Bill's cousin isn't there to greet them, but Long Bill pops out of the door and greets them himself. Rusty had to hurry home, because he had to wake up Farmer Green at dawn the next morning. When he got back to the old cherry tree, his wife wanted to know what had kept him so long, and what Mr. Frog had said. When she found out that his visit to the tailor had been for nothing, she looked very suspicious. The tailor observed that somebody has to be first, and he likes to be early at a party so he can get refreshments. Rusty Wren always thought his cousin's house was never decorated for a party. Long Bill is surprised to see his cousin Rusty, but is glad to have the company. Rusty Wren and Mr. Frog are the first to arrive at Long Bill Wren's party.

"It looks as if we were the first to get here," Rusty Wren  remarked, as they drew near Long Bill's
