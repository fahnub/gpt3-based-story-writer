Outline: Nimble, a deer, is out foraging for food when he happens upon the cave where he had waited for Cuffy Bear weeks before. He remembers how he had fed upon the green things under the snow and begins to paw away the snow to find more food.

Cuffy Bear, who had been inside the cave sleeping, wakes up and comes out to find Nimble. At first, Cuffy doesn't recognize Nimble because he has shed his horns since they last met. But once Cuffy realizes who Nimble is, he is surprised to see him because he had assumed Nimble would have left long ago.

Nimble tells Cuffy that he only stayed because he heard old dog Spot coming. Cuffy is relieved to hear this and the two animals go their separate ways.

Story so far:  Cuffy Bear and Nimble meet again after a long time apart. Cuffy Bear is surprised to see how much Nimble has changed, and Nimble points out that Cuffy Bear has changed too - he looks much hungrier. They decide to walk down the mountain together. Nimble, a deer, remembers the time he met Cuffy Bear and how he fed him green things. He thinks about this as he roams around the valley and up the side of the mountain. Nimble tells Cuffy Bear that he did not wait for him, but Cuffy Bear insists that Nimble must have been waiting for him. Nimble insists that he is a deer, and not a doe, despite having no horns. Cuffy Bear is surprised that Nimble broke his promise to wait inside the cave.

Last chunk: Nimble replied. "But please don't call me 'madam!'"  "You're not Nimble Deer. You're a Doe," Cuffy Bear insisted. "You have  no horns."  "I'm a Deer," Nimble retorted. "I had horns; but I've shed them."  Cuffy Bear _woofed_ a bit more. He seemed to be somewhat ill-tempered.  "You can't fool me," he grunted. "Nimble Deer's horns were firm upon his  head when I left him here and stepped inside this cave. He agreed to  wait for me; and I'm surprised that he broke his promise."  "I am Nimble Deer,"
