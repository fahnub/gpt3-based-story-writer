Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard.

Last chunk: while the monkey made his pathetic little  bows, and picked up the pennies Thorny threw him.  "It is warm, and you look tired.  Sit down and I'll get you some  dinner," said the young master, pointing to the seat which now stood  near the great gate.  With thanks in broken English the man gladly obeyed, and Ben begged to  be allowed to make Jacko equally comfortable, explaining that he knew  all about monkeys and what they liked. So the poor thing was freed from  his cocked hat and uniform, fed
