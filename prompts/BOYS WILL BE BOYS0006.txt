Outline: Johnnie Green is trying to go fishing, but his pony, Twinkleheels, is not cooperating. He's been trying to get Twinkleheels to behave like a little gentleman, but to no avail. When Johnnie finally catches up to him, he's so startled that he jumps sideways, and Johnnie Green all but loses his seat on Twinkleheels' back. As he lurches in the saddle he brings the fish pole smartly against Twinkleheels' head.

"I won't stand this," Twinkleheels decides. "I don't see what Johnnie is thinking of, to beat me over the head. I've certainly done nothing to deserve such treatment." Thereupon he dashed madly across the farmyard and made for the orchard.

Johnnie's hands are so full of a number of things that he can do little more than stick to the saddle. Twinkleheels has reached the orchard and already is tearing in and out among the trees. The tin pail containing Johnnie's bait slips from his grasp and clatters upon the ground, causing Twinkleheels to run all the faster. The fish pole strikes the tree trunks right and left. One end of it lodged for an instant in a branch, while the other end nearly swept Johnnie off Twinkleheels' back. Still Johnnie Green clung to it and to his lunch basket as well.

Finding himself with only a bit of the pole left in his hand, Johnnie gave it a fling, slipped an arm through the handle of his lunch basket, and set to pulling mightily on the bridle reins. Twinkleheels changed from a run to a canter, from a canter to a trot, from a trot to a walk; and finally stood still.

Then Johnnie turned him around and rode slowly back to the barn. He jumped down, unbuckled the girth, and drew off Twinkleheels' saddle.

"What's the matter?" his father asked him. "You haven't given up going fishing--have you?"

"No!" Johnnie answered. "I'm going to harness Twinkleheels to the buggy. And I'll cut a pole at the creek."

Story so far:  Johnnie Green's horse Twinkleheels breaks the whip and Johnnie is glad. Johnnie then takes Twinkleheels back to the barn at a walk. His father asks him what is wrong.

Last chunk: the bridle reins.  "There!" said Twinkleheels. "There goes that whip. I'm glad I broke it.  Now I'll let Johnnie pull me down to a walk--but not too quickly."  With Johnnie Green tugging steadily, Twinkleheels changed from a run to  a canter, from a canter to a trot, from a trot to a walk; and finally  stood still.  Then Johnnie turned him around and rode slowly back to the barn. He  jumped down, unbuckled the girth, and drew off Twinkleheels' saddle.  "What's the matter?" his father asked him.
