Outline: Rusty Wren brings home a ladybug to his wife, Mrs. Wren, who is pleased with the insect. However, Rusty soon realizes that the beetle tastes terrible and drops it on the ground.

Mrs. Wren scolds her husband for bringing home pretty red beetles for their children to eat, saying that he should know better than to bring home food that isn't fit for them. Rusty Wren's wife scolds him for bringing home a horrid-tasting beetle. Rusty insists that she must have eaten it herself, but she denies it, saying that she dropped it on the ground.
