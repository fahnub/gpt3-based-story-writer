Outline: A mother mourns the death of her child. She remembers the child's brief life, and how she will never again see or hear her child. The black bells of death toll as the child is laid to rest. The mother prays that her child is at peace and with Christ's mother in heaven.

Story so far:  The speaker is preparing the body of their deceased loved one for burial. They express how difficult it is to let go, but know that this is the best thing to do. The passage tells the story of how Hugh saved Little Red Riding-Hood from the wolf. The speaker is grateful that it was their loved one who died, and not them. Little Red Riding-Hood is saved by woodman Hugh from a wolf, who was after her. The passage describes how horrible it would be for the speaker to see the person they love die, and how grateful they are that they will not have to bear that burden.

Last chunk: horrible flowers are spread,--    I know the thing it is,    And I thank God that He has spared you this.    If one must bear it, thank God it was I    Who had to live and bear to see you die,    Who have to live, and bear to see you dead.      You will have nothing of it all to bear:    You will not even know that in your bed    You lie alone. You will not miss my head    Beside you on the pillow: you will rest    So soft in the grave you will not miss my breast.    But I--but I--Your pillow
