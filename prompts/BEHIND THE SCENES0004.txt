Outline: The story is about a woman who is a teacher at a school for children from poor families. She is trying to help a boy named Patsy who has not been coming to school. She goes to his house to find out why and meets his sister Hildegarde. Hildegarde tells her that Patsy is afraid of going to school because he is always late and gets scolded. The woman decides to try to help Patsy by encouraging him and paying him to come to school on time. She also tries to help other children in her class who are having problems.

Story so far:  This passage describes four cases of lost objects, and the speaker's frustration at the situation. Patsy had not appeared by Monday afternoon as expected, much to the disappointment of the narrator. The speaker suggests that if Miss Kate believes in Lafayette, he will do better. They say that her lack of belief saps his will power, and that instead of reproving him for being late, she should encourage him.
