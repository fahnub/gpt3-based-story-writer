Ladybug saw that Betsy Butterfly was very dusty, and Mehitable Moth was also somewhat dusty. Ladybug concluded that Betsy had been on a journey, while Mehitable thought that Betsy might have just been dusty from the rain. Mrs. Ladybug reports that she spoke with Betsy Butterfly and suspects that she paints her wings. Mrs. Ladybug is saying that Johnnie Green would have brushed Betsy Butterfly before adding her to his collection, because she is untidy. Thank you," said Mehitable. And she hurried away without another word. Jennie Junebug spoke up at once and said she would be delighted to accompany Mrs. Ladybug. Jennie confided to her companion that it's a good thing to have backs as hard and slippery as theirs so the dust can't stick to them. "There's no excuse for not keeping oneself neat," Mrs. Ladybug said severely.
