Outline: Cinderella is a kind and good girl who is treated poorly by her step-sisters and made to work as a servant in her own home. When the King of the land throws a ball, Cinderella's step-sisters go and Cinderella is left behind. She is visited by her Fairy godmother who transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, rats into horses and footmen, and Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown. Cinderella goes to the ball and meets the Prince. They dance together and fall in love. Cinderella must leave the ball before midnight or her gown will turn back into rags. She flees and loses one of her glass slippers. The Prince searches for her and finds the slipper. He declares that the woman who can fit the slipper shall be his bride. Cinderella's step-sisters try but fail. Cinderella tries on the slipper and it fits. She tells her story and is married to the Prince. They live happily ever after.

Story so far:  Cinderella is a young girl who is forced to do all the household chores and is treated poorly by her stepmother and stepsisters. However, she is a kind and patient person, and her younger sister gives her the nickname "Cinderella." The passage describes Cinderella's sisters telling her about the princess they met at the ball, and Cinderella showing no interest. A princess loses one of her glass slippers at the palace and a prince tries to find her.

Last chunk: nimble as a deer. The Prince followed, but could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully. She got home, but quite out of breath, without her carriage, and in her old clothes, having nothing left her of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to the one she had dropped. The guards at the palace gate were asked if they had not seen a princess go out, and they replied they had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly
