Outline: Once there was a king who had a daughter of remarkable beauty and he named her Fairer-than-a-Fairy. Unknowingly, this name called down the jealousy of the fairies and they resolved to take revenge on the child. The eldest fairy, Lagree, was tasked with taking the child and she did so by kidnapping her and taking her to a hidden underground palace.

The child was seven years old at the time and Lagree kept her there for years, under strict orders never to let the fire in the grate go out. One day, while the child was admiring a rainbow, she heard a voice coming from it and it turned out to be a young man who had been imprisoned in the palace by Lagree. The two of them fell in love and met often, but one day Lagree found out that the fire had gone out and she was furious.

Lagree ordered the child to go and get fire from a nearby monster, Locrinos, who was known to eat young girls. The child went, but was saved by Locrinos's wife who was charmed by her. The child made it back safely and Lagree was even more furious.

Lagree pursued the child, but she was saved by her pet dog and cat who fought off Lagree. The child continued to run and came across a wood full of sweet scents and a silver castle suspended in the air. She went inside and found her love, Prince Rainbow, asleep on a couch.

Fairer-than-a-Fairy woke him and they were reunited. The Queen, Prince Rainbow's mother, was overjoyed to see her son and they all returned to the kingdom. The wedding was celebrated and they lived happily ever after.

Story so far: A king and queen have a baby girl and name her 'Fairer-than-a-Fairy.' The fairies become jealous and try to harm the child, but she is protected by her parents and three kind sisters who have magical powers. The princess grows up and is set two easy tasks by a fairy, but she grows lonely and forgets her father's court. One day, she notices a rainbow and hears a voice coming from it. A woman spills water she had been saving and pours the contents of two bottles into the basin, causing the rainbow to disappear and taking her prince with it. The heroine is ordered by a spiteful queen to go to a cruel monster and ask for fire, knowing that he will kill her. A lady gives the Princess a nut and later a golden pomegranate with the instruction to open them in her most urgent need. The new king is about to present his wife to his mother and the court when the three green and white sisters appear and declare her true identity. The lovers are received with joy in the capital and the wedding is celebrated without delay. The old Fairy led the little girl to a pretty room and gave her two glass bottles to take care of. She then warned her not to let out the fire in the grate and vanished. The passage tells the story of a young couple who are in love but are forced to part ways. The passage describes how a fairy devised a way to meet her Rainbow without losing sight of the fire or the two bottles in which the old Fairy kept her eye and tooth.

Last chunk: made him devise  some more convenient way of meeting than by the garden fountain, and  Fairer-than-a-Fairy carried out his plan daily with entire success.  Every morning she placed a large basin full of water on her window-sill,  and as soon as the sun's rays fell on the water the Rainbow appeared  as clearly as it had ever done in the fountain. By this means they were  able to meet without losing sight of the fire or of the two bottles in  which the old Fairy kept her eye and her tooth at
