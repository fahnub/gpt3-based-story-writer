Outline: The rats and mice on the farm think that Miss Kitty Cat is a terrible person because she loves to hunt them. However, they also think it's pleasant to have her around because she can predict the weather. When old dog Spot chases her, she can be quite fierce. But around the farmhouse, she is always polite and never makes a fuss.

Johnnie Green likes Miss Kitty and often pets her. If he were her size and she were his, she might play with him like she does with a mouse. But Johnnie Green never stops to think of anything like that.

Story so far:  Miss Kitty was always polite and never caused any trouble, even though she might have been hungry or cold.

Last chunk: Around the farmhouse she was politeness itself--when there was anybody  to observe her. If her meals were late she never clamored, as Johnnie  Green sometimes did. To be sure, she might remind Mrs. Green gently, by  plaintive mewing, that she had not had her saucer of milk. But she was  always careful not to be rude about it. And though Miss Kitty liked a  warm place in winter, she never crowded anybody else away from the fire.  She crept under the kitchen range, where no one else cared to sit.
