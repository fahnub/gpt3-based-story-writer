Outline: Brer Rabbit and Miss Bob White are having a conversation when Brer Rabbit notices that something is wrong. He asks what the matter is and Miss Bob White tells him that her eggs have gone missing. Brer Rabbit offers to help her look for them and eventually finds them in his own home. He tells Miss Bob White that he found them and she is very thankful.

Brer Rabbit and the partridge nest is a fable about two animals who are having a conversation. The Whipperwill is crying on the hill, and the Bob White is choking herself with saying Good-night. The two animals know that something is wrong, and they believe that the Whipperwill and the Bob White are telling a sad tale. Brer Rabbit finds some eggs and decides to take them home and try to hatch them. Miss Bob White, after washing her dress, goes back to her house and sees Brer Rabbit. She thanks him and he bows. The speaker is a man who has been waiting to see some eggs hatch. He is worried that he is not good at sitting, and his wife says he has a slow fever. He is surprised when the eggs start to walk.

There was a time when a bob white built her nest in the open, where everyone could see it. She was very polite and would face her house east and west, and fill it with eggs. To keep them warm, she would brood and set, and keep her house clean. Brer Rabbit offers to help Miss Bob White clean her dress, and she agrees. He does a good job, and she is grateful.
