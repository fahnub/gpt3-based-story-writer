Outline: Grandfather Mole is burrowing his way through Farmer Green's garden when he is stopped by Jolly Robin. Jolly Robin asks him how long it will take Grunty Pig to dig up the apple tree where he lives. Grandfather Mole says it all depends on how much time Grunty Pig spends digging. Jolly Robin explains that Grunty Pig works every day and boasts that he will have the tree uprooted before fall. Grandfather Mole tells Jolly Robin that Grunty Pig will not be able to uprooted the tree in ninety-nine summers. Jolly Robin is pleased with this news and hurries home to his wife. Mrs. Robin is glad to see her husband and he tells her the news. Mrs. Robin says that Grunty Pig is stupid and has turned up at least a dozen angleworms while her husband was gone.

Story so far:  Mrs. Robin feels better after hearing that Grandfather Mole is the greatest burrower in Pleasant Valley. She then looks down at Grunty Pig and says to her husband that he is stupid for letting all the angleworms he found get away. A mole mistakes the surface for down below and Robin has to tell him he's above ground. The mole is old and has trouble hearing.

"Have I made the mistake again of coming  up on top of Farmer Green's garden?"  "You certainly have," Jolly told him.  "I must be getting old," said Grandfather Mole. "I'm growing more  careless every day. I didn't mean to dig my way above ground." And then,  thrusting his long nose right into the dirt, he began to burrow out of  sight.  "Stop! Please stop!" Jolly Robin
