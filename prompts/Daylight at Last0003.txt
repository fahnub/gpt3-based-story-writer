Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

Story so far: The explorers find themselves at the bottom of a deep well with an Ork. The Ork is cheerful, but the humans are dismayed. They all wonder how they will get out. The Ork offers to carry the humans up the well, but they are afraid of falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork escapes the well and is relieved to be in the sunlight again. The Ork tells the humans that he will take them with him when he leaves the cave, and the humans express concern about falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork tells Trot and Cap'n Bill that it can fly out of the shaft using its mechanical propeller tail, and proceeds to do so. The Ork and Cap'n Bill have been walking through a tunnel for some time and Trot has been sleeping. Cap'n Bill wakes Trot up and they start walking again, hoping to find an exit. The Ork said they were almost at the end of the tunnel, and they didn't need to wake up yet. Cap'n Bill lit a candle, and they saw that they were at the end of the tunnel. Cap'n Bill and Trot discover that they are on an island after walking through a small forest. The sailor-man and Trot find a light at the end of the tunnel, revealing that they had only made two sharp turns instead of encountering a wall of rock.

Last chunk: of this place when we went to sleep."  The sailor-man and Trot came forward with a light. A wall of rock  really faced the tunnel, but now they saw that the opening made a sharp  turn to the left. So they followed on, by a narrower passage, and then  made another sharp turn this time to the right.  "Blow out the light, Cap'n," said the Ork, in a pleased voice. "We've  struck daylight."  Daylight at last! A shaft of mellow light fell almost at their feet as  Trot and the sailor turned the corner
