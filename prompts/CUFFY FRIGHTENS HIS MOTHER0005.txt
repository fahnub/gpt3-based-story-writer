Outline: Cuffy Bear has a run-in with some bees and comes home with his face swollen and in pain. His family doesn't recognize him and his father tells him to leave. Cuffy starts to cry and says it's only him, at which point his family realizes who he is. His mother helps him to bed and he falls asleep. A few days later, he and his father go back to the bee tree to get some honey. They discover that it's not a bee tree at all, but a hornet's nest.

Last chunk: breakfast, his father had told him to say "It is I," instead  of "It is _me_." But Cuffy forgot all about that, now.  "What! Are you my Cuffy?" his father exclaimed. For he knew Cuffy at  last. You see, the bees hadn't stung Cuffy's _voice_. And in no time at  all Cuffy was tucked into his little bed and his mother was gently  licking his poor, aching face with her tongue.
