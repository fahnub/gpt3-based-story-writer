Outline: Johnnie Green has been to the circus and wants to try out some of the tricks he saw there. He first tries to get his dog Spot to jump through a hoop of fire, but the dog refuses. Johnnie then goes to the pasture and brings Snowball Lamb back to the farmyard, intending to teach her some tricks so they can join the circus next year.

It takes Johnnie a long time to teach Snowball to jump through a wooden hoop on command, but eventually he succeeds. He then tries to teach her to jump through a paper hoop, but she has difficulty with this. Johnnie decides to make a bigger hoop for the Muley Cow to jump through, but when he is milking her she gets impatient and smacks him with her tail.

Johnnie stops daydreaming and finishes milking the cow, then goes back to the woodshed and looks at the four paper hoops he has made.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green tells Snowball the sheep that he will need to learn to jump through a paper hoop if they want to join the circus. Snowball baas in response, and Johnnie goes off to make some paper hoops. Johnnie spends the afternoon knocking old barrels apart and making hoops out of them. His father comes along and tells him to work harder, so Johnnie decides to make one more hoop. This passage describes Napoleon's plans to build hoops for the circus. He thinks that four hoops would be enough to practice with, but he and Snowball would need dozens of hoops if they joined the circus. He goes to milk the Muley Cow, thinking about how to build a big hoop.

Last chunk: or other,  that four hoops would be enough to practice with. Of course when he and  Snowball joined the circus they would need dozens of hoops. But there  wasn't really any hurry about that.  So he went for a milk pail and trotted off to the barn, where he sat  down on his three-legged stool and began milking the Muley Cow.  He couldn't help thinking, as he sat there and sent streams of milk  tinkling down upon the bottom of the tin pail, what a fine scheme it  would be to build a hoop big
