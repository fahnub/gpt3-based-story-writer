Outline: Timothy Turtle is annoyed when he sees Johnnie Green fishing in his favorite pool in Black Creek. He watches as Johnnie catches three big fish, including the one Timothy was planning to eat for dinner. When Johnnie moves further up the creek, Timothy follows him, complaining to his neighbors along the way.

Peter Mink suggests that Timothy write a letter to Farmer Green, and Timothy agrees, telling Peter to find somebody to write it. When Timothy reaches the spot where Johnnie was fishing, he finds a string of seven pickerel that Johnnie has left there.

Timothy Turtle suddenly changes his mind about sending a letter to Farmer Green. He wishes that Johnnie would come there to fish every day. When Peter Mink meets Timothy the next day, Timothy tells him to go back and tell Mr. Crow that he hopes Johnnie Green will come twice a day to fish until he has caught every fish in Black Creek.

Timothy Turtle gets angry at Johnnie Green for catching too many fish, and tells his neighbors about it. Peter Mink suggests that Timothy speak to Farmer Green about the issue. Mr. Crow told Peter Mink that he would be willing to pull out one of his quills to use as a pen to write a letter to Farmer Green, but only if it was somebody other than Peter himself.

Last chunk: anything more. Of course he was only talking  to himself, anyhow. And he seized the string of pickerel and waddled  into the bushes, where he ate every one of those seven fish.  When Peter Mink met Timothy the next day he said he had not yet found  anybody who would write the letter to Farmer Green.  "Mr. Crow told me that if it was anybody but you he might be willing to  pull out one of his quills for a pen," Peter explained. "But he said  that he hoped Johnnie Green would come here every day
