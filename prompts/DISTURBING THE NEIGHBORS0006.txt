Outline: Long Bill Wren's wife is not a fan of their neighbor Ferdinand Frog, after he makes a blundering remark about her children. Long Bill often tells her that Mr. Frog must have been joking, but she is adamant that he is not a safe person to have around.

One day, Mrs. Wren tells her husband that she saw Mr. Frog pull off his own skin and swallow it. Long Bill is surprised and worried, and his wife suggests that he go tell Aunt Polly Woodchuck, the herb-doctor.

However, before he can do anything, Mrs. Wren notices that Mr. Frog has gone into the creek for a swim. Long Bill is worried that he will get a cramp and drown, but sure enough, Mr. Frog sinks before their eyes.

After a long time, Mr. Frog finally reappears, much to the relief of the worried crowd that had gathered. He tells them that he was just taking a mud bath at the bottom of the creek and advises them all to try one.

Story so far:  The passage describes how a group of people became worried after their strange neighbor disappeared while swimming in Black Creek. They eventually came to the conclusion that he must have drowned after getting a cramp from swimming too soon after eating, and they were glad they had not let him teach their children to swim. Mr. Frog has been taking mud baths and advises others to do the same, as they are very healthful.

Last chunk: this--a party?" a voice called suddenly from under the bank. And  then Mr. Frog himself, looking fine and fit, hopped up and stood before  the company, with a broad grin on his face.  "Where have you been?" they shouted. "We were worried about you."  "Oh, I've been having a mud bath at the bottom of the creek," Mr. Frog  told them. "Mud baths, you know, are very healthful. And I advise you  all to try one."
