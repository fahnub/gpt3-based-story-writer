Story so far: The animals are discussing how they believe Buldeo will be able to find and kill the Devil-child (Mowgli). They are worried about the Wolf-demon, which they believe could appear at any time. The Eaters of Flesh are attacking a village, and the deer, pig, and nilghai are milling around in a circle. The men in the village are sitting on platforms in the crops, waiting to defend themselves. The speaker is saying that the men in the village are foolish to leave Messua unguarded while they listen to Buldeo's stories. Mowgli helps Messua escape the village, and tells her not to be afraid. He says the jungle is dark and terrible, but she will be safe if she follows the trail to Khanhiwara. The passage describes a man's reaction to finding out that his wife and her friend are witches. He is angry and demands to know why they are witches. They explain that they are witches because they were too kind to him and gave him shelter and milk when he was a child. Mowgli, Akela, and Gray Brother are being followed by Buldeo, who is trying to track them.

Last chunk: Mowgli had left the village with the heavy weight  of Shere Khan's raw hide on his shoulders, while Akela and Gray Brother  trotted behind, so that the triple trail was very clearly marked.  Presently Buldeo came to where Akela, as you know, had gone back and  mixed it all up. Then he sat down, and coughed and grunted, and made  little casts round and about into the Jungle to pick it up again, and,  all the time he could have thrown a stone over those who were watching  him. No one can be so
