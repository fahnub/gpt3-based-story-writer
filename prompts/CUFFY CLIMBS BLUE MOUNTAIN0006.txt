Outline: Cuffy Bear climbs Blue Mountain and finds a bird's nest with two eggs. He breaks one of the eggs and begins to eat it when he hears a loud scream. He realizes the scream is coming from a giant bird and tumbles down the cliff to escape it.

Story so far:  Cuffy sees an enormous bird dropping down on him, and he is surprised by its size. Cuffy, a small bird, is chased by a much larger eagle. Cuffy tumbles down a cliff to escape the eagle, who follows him.

Last chunk: the great bird had a  wicked, hooked beak and claws that were as sharp as his own, and ever so  much longer.  One look was enough for Cuffy. He turned and tumbled down the steep  cliff, head over heels, with the eagle following him.
