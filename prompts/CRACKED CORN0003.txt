Outline: Johnnie Green is trying to teach his lamb, Snowball, how to jump through hoops so they can join the circus. He starts by using a bare hoop, and when Snowball does well, he rewards him with some cracked corn. They continue practicing and Johnnie is able to get Snowball to jump through one of the paper hoops he had made the day before.

Farmer Green catches Johnnie giving Snowball the cracked corn and scolds him, but Johnnie is able to convince him that they're just trying to keep Snowball thin so he can jump better. In the end, Farmer Green agrees to let Johnnie continue giving Snowball the occasional treat of cracked corn.

Story so far:  Johnnie is telling his father that he is feeding some of his chicken feed to Snowball, and Farmer Green replies that he must be fattening the lamb for market. Johnnie insists that he would never sell Snowball, and Farmer Green teases him by saying that maybe his hens are actually circus animals. Snowball the goat is overweight, and Johnnie thinks that maybe jumping will help him lose some weight. Johnnie is pleased with Snowball's behavior and rewards him with a handful of cracked corn. Snowball is content and thinks about how the black lamb would like the corn. Johnnie Green asks if he can give Snowball, the lamb, corn once in a while, and Farmer Green says that he supposes so. Johnnie is playing with Snowball, his pet chicken, and is successful in getting her to jump through a paper hoop. He is so delighted that he goes back to the chicken house to get her some cracked corn as a reward. Unfortunately, he runs into his father, who is not happy to see him with the corn.

Unluckily, just as he came out of the chicken house he met his father  going in.  "Here!" Farmer Green exclaimed. "What are you doing with my
