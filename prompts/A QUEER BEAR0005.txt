Outline: Grunty Pig tells his mother he saw a bear, but she does not believe him. She punishes him for lying, but the next day he runs away again and is warned by the Muley Cow about bears. He does not believe her and stays in the pasture, but when it gets dark he is scared and goes home.

Story so far:  Grunty Pig is punished for running away and telling fibs, but he cannot resist the call of the fields and slips away again. Grunty Pig tells his mother that the bear that chased him was whitish with brown spots, had a long tail, and six legs. Mrs. Pig makes a strange noise, and Grunty Pig realizes that he described a dog, not a bear. The woman in the passage thinks that the man will change his tune when it gets dark. Grunty Pig has decided to stay in the pasture forever, and mocks the Muley Cow for trying to warn him about the bears.

Last chunk: "I'll stay in the pasture  the rest of my life. There's plenty to eat here; and plenty of fun,  too."  It was afternoon when Grunty Pig made up his mind that he would never  go home. When the Muley Cow warned him once more to beware of the bears  he actually jeered at her.  "There are no bears in Pleasant Valley," he scoffed. "And you needn't  trouble yourself to mention them again to me. I'm going to live in this  pasture and there's no use of your trying to frighten me away."  The Muley Cow
