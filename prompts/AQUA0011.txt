Outline: Aqua is a water droplet who lives in the ocean with his mother. He grows tired of playing in the ocean and begs the sun to take him on a journey to see the earth. The sun agrees and transforms Aqua into vapor so that he can ride on the sunbeams.

Aqua has a grand time sailing through the air and looking down at the world below, but when the sun sets he grows scared and tries to return to the ocean. He falls back to earth and lands in a rosebush. The next day he tries again and this time he ends up in a flour mill, where he and his fellow water droplets work the machinery.

Eventually Aqua and his brothers end up in a river which leads them back to the ocean. Aqua is happy to be back home with his mother and tells her all about his adventures.

Story so far: Aqua is a water droplet who falls from the sky and becomes frightened as the sun sets. He tries to get back to the earth, and grows heavier as he falls lower, until he is a drop of water again, landing on a rosebush. This passage describes how water droplets can grind wheat into flour and corn into meal, and how they can also spin a giant wheel. The brook where they live leads to a pond where ducks and geese swim. The passage describes a scene in which a boy sleeps among velvet cushions and is then carried away by the sunbeams. The boy becomes tired and pleads with the sun to let him go back. Aqua jumps from the Ocean's arms and begs the Sun to catch him up and take him on a journey to see the earth. The Sun agrees and takes many other drops of water with him, turning them all into mist or vapor. The wind takes pity on a thirsty man and blows him, along with all his brothers, into a heavy gray cloud. The cloud then rains down on the earth. Some of the drops fall on a mountain side, including Aqua. This passage describes the author's experience of watching a steamer travel down a river. The steamer's journey is full of activity and movement, and the author describes the different sights the steamer passes along the way. Aqua and his brothers help a river float heavy ships, even though it was only a little rill before.

Last chunk: bridge for a long, long  distance, until they saw another brook tumbling down a hillside.  "Come, let's join hands!" cried Aqua; and so they all dashed on together  till they came to a broad river which opened its arms to them.  By the help of Aqua and his brothers the beautiful river was able to  float heavy ships, though not so long ago it was only a little rill,  through which a child could wade or over which he could step. Here a  vessel loaded with lumber was carried just as easily as if it
