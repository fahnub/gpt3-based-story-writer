Outline: The story is about a darning-needle who believes she is an embroidery-needle and is very proud. She is being used by the fingers to sew a shoe upper leather and is not happy with the common work. She breaks and is then stuck in the front of the cook's dress with sealing-wax. She is now a breast-pin and is very proud of herself. She talks to a bit of bottle-glass and they both think they are very costly. The bit of bottle-glass is washed away and the darning-needle is left. Two boys find her and stick her in an egg-shell. A wagon-wheel goes over her but she does not break.

Story so far:  The Darning-needle is very slim, and thinks she is even finer than before. The boys stick her into an egg-shell, and she says she is glad to be seen to advantage. She is not sea-sick, and thinks it is good to be steeled against it. The darning needle is proud and falls into the sink. It gets lost and ends up in the gutter, saying it is too fine for this world. The Darning-needle is very proud of herself after being promoted to a breast-pin. She laughs to herself and then asks the Pin if she is made of gold. Two children are playing in the gutter when one of them finds a darning needle and pricks himself. The darning needle protests that it is actually a young lady, but no one hears her. The sealing wax has gone and she has become black, but black is still a beautiful color.

Last chunk: weep; but I can't--it is not fine  to weep!'  One day two street-urchins were playing and wading in the gutter,  picking up old nails, pennies, and such things. It was rather dirty  work, but it was a great delight to them.  'Oh, oh!' cried out one, as he pricked himself with the Darning-needle;  'he is a fine fellow though!'  'I am not a fellow; I am a young lady!' said the Darning-needle; but no  one heard. The sealing-wax had gone, and she had become quite black; but  black makes one look
