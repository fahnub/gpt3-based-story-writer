Outline: In this delightful rhyme, a mother tries to soothe her crying baby by offering a variety of food options. The baby seems to be interested in neither bread nor custard, but the mother is determined to find something that will please her little one. Ultimately, the baby is pacified with a tart.

Story so far:  This is a lullaby telling a baby not to cry, and that the singer will give them food.

Last chunk: BABY DOLLY (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)  Hush, baby, my dolly, I pray you don't cry,  And I'll give you some bread, and some milk by-and-by;  Or perhaps you like custard, or, maybe, a tart,  Then to either you're welcome, with all my heart.
