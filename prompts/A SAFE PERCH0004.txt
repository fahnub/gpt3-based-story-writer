Outline: Turkey Proudfoot tries to teach six geese the "stylish strut," but they are too stupid to learn and instead follow him around the farmyard. The other animals on the farm think that the geese are chasing Turkey Proudfoot and start to crow and squawk. Turkey Proudfoot leads the geese to a tree and orders them to stay there, then tells the other animals that he ordered the geese to go for a swim.
