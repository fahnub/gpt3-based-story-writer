Outline: Aunt Polly Woodchuck is a famous doctor who is called to Mrs. Rabbit's house to treat Jimmy for mumps. However, when Aunt Polly arrives, she discovers that it is not Jimmy who is sick, but the hot-water bottle that is full of holes. Aunt Polly shows Mrs. Rabbit how to prevent the new hot-water bottle from getting full of holes and then hangs the old one around Jimmy's neck. Jimmy is uncomfortable with the hot-water bottle around his neck, but is glad that Aunt Polly has not told his mother what he did.

Story so far:  Aunt Polly Woodchuck hangs a hot-water bottle from Jimmy Rabbit's neck to treat his holes-in-hot-water-bottles problem. Aunt Polly is teaching Mrs. Rabbit how to prevent her hot-water bottle from getting full of holes.

Last chunk: she looked at the  hot-water bottle closely. "I thought so!" she said.  "What is it?" Mrs. Rabbit inquired. "I hope it's nothing catching. For  just think what a fix we'd be in if all the children should have that  same trouble!"  Aunt Polly told her not to worry.  "You'd better get a new bottle," she said, "for this one can't be cured.  But I'll show you what to do to prevent the new hot-water bottle from  getting full of holes like this one.... Get me a piece of string!" said  Aunt Polly.
