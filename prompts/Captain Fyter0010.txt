Outline: Captain Fyter was a soldier who fell in love with a beautiful Munchkin girl named Nimmie Amee. The Wicked Witch who didn't want them to be together enchanted his sword and he was gradually cut to pieces. He went to the tinsmith, Ku-Klip, who made him into a Tin Soldier. Nimmie Amee's tin sweetheart, Nick Chopper (the Tin Woodman), had disappeared and she took an interest in the Tin Soldier. They were going to elope on the day of their wedding, but the Wicked Witch came back and he had to stand in the forest rusting. The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Woot the Wanderer came across him and he told his story. They all decided that the Tin Soldier and the Tin Woodman should both go to Nimmie Amee's house and she could choose between them.

Story so far:  Nimmie Amee falls in love with Nick Chopper after he gets his tin limbs, and they set a wedding date. The Scarecrow tells the Tin Soldier of all that has happened in the Land of Oz since he was last rusted in the forest. The Tin Soldier agrees to go with the Scarecrow to Nimmie Amee's house and let her choose between them. The Woodman and the Soldier are both in love with Nimmie Amee. The Soldier offers to let the Woodman marry her, since he cannot love her as he did before he became tin. Woot points out that one of them should marry her, since she likes tin men.

Last chunk: the Emerald City in search of a heart that could love.  "If you have found such a heart, sir," said the Soldier, "I will gladly allow you to marry Nimmie Amee in my place."  "If she loves you best, sir," answered the Woodman, "I shall not interfere with your wedding her. For, to be quite frank with you, I cannot yet love Nimmie Amee as I did before I became tin."  "Still, one of you ought to marry the poor girl," remarked Woot; "and, if she likes tin men, there is not much choice between you.
