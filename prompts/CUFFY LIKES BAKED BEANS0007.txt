Outline: Cuffy Bear finds Farmer Green's lunch basket and eats everything inside, including a pot of baked beans. He enjoys them so much that he wishes the pot was bigger. When he's finished, he finds that the pot is stuck to his nose. He tries to remove it, but can't, so he decides to go home. His family laughs at him and his mother is happy to get the iron pot. Cuffy escapes being punished.

Story so far:  Cuffy feels uncomfortable and wonders how he will ever get rid of the pot over his nose. He is puzzled by the thought of how he will be able to eat again. When he reaches home, his family is very worried about him. Mr. Bear pulls the bean-pot off his son's nose, and Cuffy is himself again.

Last chunk: Silkie all laughed so  hard at the sight of him that Cuffy began to whimper. And a big tear  rolled from each eye, ran down the bean-pot, and dropped off the bottom  of it.  And then, with just one tug Mr. Bear pulled the bean-pot off his son's  nose; and Cuffy was himself again.  He escaped a punishing, too, that time. And Mrs. Bear was very glad to  get such a nice iron pot. She had wanted one for a long time.
