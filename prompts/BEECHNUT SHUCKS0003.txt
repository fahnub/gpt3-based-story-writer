Outline: Frisky Squirrel is visiting Farmer Green's place and is looking for some beechnuts. He finds some beechnut shucks near the woodshed door and begins to nibble on them. Miss Kitty Cat, who is inside the woodshed, smells the squirrel and begins to stalk him. Frisky Squirrel smells the cat and tries to escape, but the cat catches him.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow tells Frisky the Squirrel to turn back because there is a cat at the farmhouse. A squirrel smells a beechnut and falls over when he sees a cat in the doorway. Frisky the cat is hoping to find some food in the farmyard, but all the corn has been eaten by Henrietta Hen. He then smells beechnuts and heads towards the woodshed. Mr. Crow warned Frisky Squirrel not to hurt the cat, and Frisky promised not to.

Last chunk: Old Mr. Crow _haw-hawed_.  "I don't believe," he croaked, "you've ever met a cat."  "No, I haven't," Frisky Squirrel replied, "but I'd like to see one. So  I'll be on my way. But don't worry, Mr. Crow? I won't hurt her." And  then Frisky started off along the top of the stone wall once more, at a  somewhat brisker pace to make up for lost time.  "He can't say I didn't warn him," Mr. Crow exclaimed as he watched the  bouncing bit of gray fur.  "I hope Mr. Crow won't worry," said Frisky Squirrel
