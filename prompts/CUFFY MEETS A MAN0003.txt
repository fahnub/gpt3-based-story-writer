Outline: Cuffy, a greedy little bear, sticks his paws into a pot of boiling maple syrup and gets them covered in the sticky substance. In a panic, he runs outside and shoves his paws into a snowbank in an attempt to cool them down.

Cuffy doesn't realize that the man who tended the sugar-house fire is still nearby, and when the man sees Cuffy, the bear takes off running in the opposite direction. The man gives chase for a few steps but soon realizes he won't be able to catch Cuffy.

Cuffy runs all the way up a mountainside until he's out of breath and his paws are covered in balls of snow. He's so frightened that he forgets all about his burns and sits down behind a knoll near his home, hoping his mother won't see him.

Once he's caught his breath, Cuffy starts nibbling at his snow mittens and is eventually able to remove them. He nibbles at his paws until he's able to suck the maple syrup off them, and he's delighted to find that the syrup is even sweeter than anything he's ever tasted.

Last chunk: when he heard Cuffy's shrieks he  looked around in great surprise. He and Cuffy saw each other at the same  time. And like a flash Cuffy turned and fairly flew the other way.  The man ran after him for a few steps. But he soon saw that he could  never catch Cuffy. So he stood still and watched the little bear bob  into the woods and vanish.  Poor Cuffy's heart was beating as if it would burst. He was so  frightened that he forgot all about his burned paws and he ran and ran  and ran up the steep
