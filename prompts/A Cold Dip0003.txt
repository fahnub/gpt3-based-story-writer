Outline: In this fable, Peter Mink is a creature who enjoys swimming and spends a lot of time near water sources in Pleasant Valley. One winter day, he decides to take a swim in the brook. Master Meadow Mouse, another creature in the valley, is also aware of Peter Mink's swimming habits and knows that he likes to swim under the ice.

 Master Meadow Mouse is determined to take a cold dip himself, despite the danger of encountering Peter Mink. He is careful, peeking out of his tunnel to look for Peter Mink before he ventures out. However, one day Peter Mink is too quick for him and Master Meadow Mouse is forced to retreat back into his tunnel.

Despite the close call, Master Meadow Mouse continues to take cold dips in the brook. One day, he is joined by a member of the Muskrat family, who are also aware of the danger of Peter Mink. The Muskrat gives a loud slap on the water's surface with its tail as a warning signal when it sees Peter Mink, and Master Meadow Mouse is able to safely enjoy his swim.

Story so far:  Mouse sees Peter Mink and knows that he is up to trouble. He decides to take the extra trouble of peeping out before he has his swim. The passage describes how Peter Mink surprises many meadow mice while they are swimming in a brook. The mice seem to enjoy swimming even in winter, and they have created tunnels leading to the brook so they can access it easily. Master Meadow Mouse always waits an instant before diving into his tunnel, in case Peter Mink is around. He knows that if he doesn't check, he might never make it home. Master Meadow Mouse always felt safer when one of the Muskrat family happened to be taking a swim at the same time, because they had a warning signal that told everybody when there was danger. Peter Mink is a water-loving creature who spends most of his time near or in various bodies of water. He likes to swim and dawdle, and doesn't mind small streams. Master Meadow Mouse is aware of Peter Mink's trick to travel underneath the ice instead of walking on top of it.

Last chunk: supposed that Master Meadow Mouse wasn't  going to have a swim when he wanted one.  When Peter Mink wandered along a stream in winter he preferred to travel  under the ice, rather than walk upon the upper side of it. It made  little difference to him whether there was a dry strip along the edge of  the stream, where he could steal silently along without wetting his  feet. When he found no place to walk, he swam.  Now, Master Meadow Mouse was well aware of this trick of Peter  Mink's--this trick
