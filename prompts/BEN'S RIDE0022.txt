Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far:  Sally Folsom, Bab, and Maria Newcomb competed in a archery competition. Billy did well, but got nervous when his last arrow was his only chance to win. The passage describes a boy who is a regular jockey and is very skilled. Farmer Paine is amazed by the boy's abilities and follows him with his eyes as he rides away. The bay mare that the boy is riding is also very fast and does a great job. Two sisters are taking care of a wounded dog. One of them goes to find the dog's owner, Mr. Rough, but instead finds a naughty boy who starts chasing her. Benny Badger finds an owl living in a prairie dog house. When he asks the owl where the prairie dog is, the owl says that he doesn't know or care where the prairie dog went. The boy in the passage is looking for a girl named Lita, who he thinks may have gone to a house in the field. He sees something dark moving behind a rock in the field and goes to investigate, finding Miss Celia lying there. The passage describes a child's fear of going down a well, and how his dog Nox comes to save him. The speaker Thorny says that Ben's dog Sanch couldn't find his way home without help, and Miss Celia says that a dog once found its way from Paris to Milan and died of fatigue the next day, so there's hope that Sanch will come home.

Last chunk: wiles off? Oh, he couldn't find you without help, smart as he  is," answered Thorny, incredulously.  Ben looked discouraged, but Miss Celia cheered him up again by saying,--  "Yes, he could.  My father had a friend who left a little dog in Paris;  and the creature found her in Milan, and died of fatigue next day. That  was very wonderful, but true; and I've no doubt that if Sanch is alive  he will come home. Let us hope so, and be happy, while we wait."  "We will!" said the boys; and day after
