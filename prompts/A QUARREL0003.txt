Outline: Kiddie Katydid and Leaper the Locust quarreled over a message that was meant for Mr. Grasshopper. They drew a crowd around them and a stranger who looked like he had travelled a long distance and had a mail-pouch slung over his back asked about the dispute. Kiddie and Leaper explained the quarrel to him and the stranger said that he had the message in his mail-bag but he didn't know which one it was meant for. Leaper the Locust gave a great shout and said that the message was meant for Kiddie Katydid. The stranger gave the message to Kiddie and Leaper the Locust was too late.

Story so far:  Kiddie Katydid and Leaper the Locust quarrel over who the message "for Mr. Grasshopper" is meant for.

Leaper the Locust mistakes Kiddie Katydid for a grasshopper with short horns, and the stranger confirms this mistaken identity. Kiddie Katydid and Leaper the Locust are excited to receive a message, but when Kiddie Katydid jumps for it, he misses and the message ends up in Leaper's hands. A stranger that looks like he has travelled a long distance asks about a dispute and listens to the whole story.

Furthermore, he was enough like  Kiddie and Leaper to be a cousin of either one of them.  A person couldn't see his horns, on account of the hat that he wore.  When this traveller asked about the dispute, everybody hastened to  explain the quarrel to him.
