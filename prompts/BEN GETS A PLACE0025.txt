Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes a boy's encounter with the Duke of Wellington and how the boy is not afraid of the Duke. Benjamin Bat has been eyeing Freddie Firefly for a while, and he always comments on how plump Freddie is getting. One evening, when they meet in Farmer Green's dooryard, Freddie asks Benjamin what he was going to say. Benjamin responds that he was just talking to himself, and Freddie calls him a "queer one." Ebenezer tells Twinkleheels that racing him would be good practice, and Twinkleheels thanks him.

The passage describes a boy's experience with measles, and how he fought a bumblebee afterwards. Betty and Bab are interested in hearing about his experiences. The passage describes a boy named Alfred who is digging in the dirt. His mother scolds him and tells him that there is no dirt where they are going. Alfred replies that he is a bad child and that his father often tells him so. The passage describes a scene in which the narrator's horse, Duke, is being harnessed by a young ostler. The old Squire comes out and approves of the ostler's work, but does not say anything to the boy, Ben. Ben then drives four cows down the road to a pasture.

Last chunk: at the door in a surprisingly short time, with a smiling  little ostler at Duke's head when the Squire came out.  His affection for the horse pleased the old gentleman, and his neat way  of harnessing suited as well; but Ben got no praise, except a nod and a  brief "All right, boy," as the equipage went creaking and jogging away.  Four sleek cows filed out of the barnyard when Pat opened the gate, and  Ben drove them down the road to a distant pasture where the early grass  awaited their eager
