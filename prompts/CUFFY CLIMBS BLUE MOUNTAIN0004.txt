Outline: Cuffy Bear climbs Blue Mountain and finds a bird's nest with two eggs. He breaks one of the eggs and begins to eat it when he hears a loud scream. He realizes the scream is coming from a giant bird and tumbles down the cliff to escape it.

Story so far:  Cuffy sees an enormous bird dropping down on him, and he is surprised by its size. Cuffy, a small bird, is chased by a much larger eagle. Cuffy tumbles down a cliff to escape the eagle, who follows him. Cuffy finds a bird's nest with two eggs on a mountain. Cuffy climbs a mountain and finds birds' eggs. He enjoys one egg and is just about to start on the second when he hears a scream. He looks around, thinking it might be a pig, but he doesn't see anything.

Last chunk: least, that was what Cuffy thought then. For he was very  fond of birds' eggs, and his climb had made him even hungrier than  usual. He stopped then and there and with one rap of the paw he broke  one of the eggs and began to eat it.  Cuffy was enjoying his lunch very much. He had almost finished the first  egg and was just about to turn to the other when he heard a deafening  scream.  Cuffy looked all around. He thought that perhaps there was a pig up  there on the mountain. But no! He couldn't
