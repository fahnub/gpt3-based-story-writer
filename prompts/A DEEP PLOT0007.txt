Outline: As time goes on, Betsy Butterfly grows increasingly fond of Joseph Bumble, despite the fact that she never sees him with his cousin Buster Bumblebee. Finally, she asks him why they never seem to hang out together, and Joseph explains that they have different interests and that he would much rather spend time with her than with Buster.

Betsy's other admirers become jealous of the time she spends with Joseph and hatch a plan to find out more about him. They ask Daddy Longlegs to invite Buster to a party in the meadow, thinking that Joseph will also show up. Joseph does indeed come to the party, but Buster is nowhere to be found. It quickly becomes apparent that Joseph has been lying about his relationship to Buster, and the other animals kick him out of the meadow.

Story so far:  Chirpy Cricket is throwing a party and is hurrying to get back in time to put on his best coat. He is reminded by his father to invite Betsy Butterfly and Joseph Bumble. Chirpy Cricket says they don't need to invite Joseph Bumble because he will come without being asked. Everybody thinks it would be a good idea to have Buster Bumblebee meet his cousin in the meadow, and Daddy Longlegs is chosen to deliver the invitation. Daddy Longlegs invites Buster Bumblebee to a party at his house and starts back home. The passage describes a person watching a scene.
