Outline: Seven friends are digging for treasure in the garden when they suddenly fall into a hidden tunnel. One of the boys, Albert, is buried under the rubble. The others frantically dig him out and he is unharmed but upset. They all share the two half-crowns they find as treasure.

Story so far: It is better to be doing something than to be talking, and it is more fun to help others than to think only of ourselves. Albert-next-door's uncle has found two half-crowns in the same place. Dora says she was looking at the spot just before and didn't see them. Albert-next-door's uncle tells the boys that their chances of finding buried treasure are slim, as he has studied the subject extensively and knows that most buried treasure only consists of a single coin. Albert-next-door wants to dig a tunnel and suggests that he go in feet first. We agree and he slowly disappears into the hole until only his head is sticking out. He then tells us to start digging. Dicky went to tell the cook to tell Albert-next-door's uncle that he had been buried by mistake, and to come and help dig him out. The screaming went on while he was gone. The passage describes how a group of children put a boy in a tunnel as punishment, but he refused to go in head first. Oswald and his siblings make Albert, the youngest, go into a long and narrow hole to dig for treasure, even though he is scared. Alice, the eldest, tells him that he just has to crawl in and dig with his hands, and they will scrape out what he digs up with the spades.

Last chunk: long, and big enough to creep  along to find the treasure, if only it had been a bit longer. Now it was  Albert's turn to go in and dig, but he funked it.  'Take your turn like a man,' said Oswald--nobody can say that Oswald  doesn't take his turn like a man. But Albert wouldn't. So we had to make  him, because it was only fair.  'It's quite easy,' Alice said. 'You just crawl in and dig with your  hands. Then when you come out we can scrape out what you've done, with  the spades. Come--be a man.
