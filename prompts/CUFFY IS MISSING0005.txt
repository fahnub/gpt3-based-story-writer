Outline: Cuffy Bear has gone into a cave to hibernate for the winter and Nimble the rabbit has promised to wait for him outside. When Cuffy doesn't come out after several hours, Nimble begins to worry and goes in search of help. He first asks Peter Mink, but Peter is uninterested and won't help. Nimble then finds Mr. Grouse, who tells him that Cuffy is most likely in a deep sleep and won't wake up until spring.

And just as he was nibbling beside a bush somebody said,  "Don't step on me!"  It was Mr. Grouse, half buried in the snow.  "I wondered why you were waiting here so long," Mr.
