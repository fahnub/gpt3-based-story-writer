Outline: Frisky Squirrel is caught in Farmer Green's attic after getting in through an open window in search of butternuts. He is unable to get back out again after the window is closed by Farmer Green's wife during a storm. Frisky spends the night in the attic, worrying about what will happen to him. In the morning, he is relieved to see that the window is open again and he is able to make his escape.

He never once thought of that, he was in such a hurry to taste those  nuts.  He just ate and ate and ate; and he was so busy cracking the nuts and  picking out the meats that he never noticed that it
