Outline: Eliza overhears her master, Mr. Shelby, and his wife discussing the sale of her young son, Harry, and decides to take matters into her own hands. She bundles up the child and flees in the night, headed for the home of her husband, George. Along the way, she is met by her friend and fellow slave, Uncle Tom, who tells her that he too has been sold and is to be collected the following day.

Eliza continues on to George's home, where she finds him packing his belongings in preparation for his own escape. She convinces him to take her and Harry with him, and the three set off into the night.

As they travel, they are pursued by men sent by Mr. Shelby to retrieve them. In a moment of desperation, Eliza crosses a frozen river with Harry in her arms, managing to reach the other side just as the ice begins to give way. The men pursuing them are forced to turn back, and Eliza and her family are safe.

Eliza has run away to save her son and is asking her husband to come after her. The Shelbys are selling Tom and Harry, and Eliza is upset because she overheard the conversation.

Last chunk: Shelby. 'I have sold everything I can think of, and at any rate now that Haley has set his heart on having Tom and Harry, he would not take anything or anybody instead.'  Mrs. Shelby cried very much about it, but at last, though she was very, very unhappy she fell asleep.  But some one whom Mr. and Mrs. Shelby never thought of was listening to this talk.  Eliza was sitting in the next room. The door was not quite closed, so she could not help hearing what was said. As she listened she grew pale
