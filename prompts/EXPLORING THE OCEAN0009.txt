Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

The mermaids' guests found the meal very satisfying, and there was no danger of them being hungry while they remained the guests of the mermaids. The meal ended with ice cream, which surprised the child guests, since they thought it would be impossible to get ice at the bottom of the sea.

Last chunk: example. Certain it is they found the meal very  satisfying, and evidently there was no danger of their being hungry  while they remained the guests of the mermaids. When the fruits  came, Trot thought that must be the last course of the big dinner,  but following the fruits were ice creams frozen into the shape of  flowers.  "How funny," said the child, "to be eating ice cream at the bottom  of the sea."  "Why does that surprise you?" inquired the Queen.  "I can't see where you get the ice to
