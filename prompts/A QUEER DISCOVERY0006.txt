Outline: Benny Badger is taking a sun nap when he hears three coyotes talking quietly to each other. He learns they are planning to visit a prairie dog village nearby and Benny is intrigued. He decides to follow them and see for himself if there is really a prairie dog village nearby.

He follows their trail and eventually comes across the village. He sees an owl sitting on a heap of earth and approaches him. The owl tells Benny that he is somebody and that there is no need to dig in the hole since he lives there.

Benny Badger is content to chat with the owl and learn more about the village. He eventually goes on his way, leaving the village and the owl behind.

Story so far:  The coyotes were headed for a prairie dog village just beyond the next rise, which surprised Benny Badger. Benny Badger is tempted to call out to the coyotes to ask if they are really telling the truth, but decides it would be better to wait and see what happens. The owl tells Benny that there is no need to dig a hole, because the owl is somebody and lives there. Benny Badger follows the trail of three coyotes to the top of a rise, where he sees the mounds of prairie dogs spread out before him. There, he notices an owl sitting on a heap of earth near a hole. When Benny greets the owl, the owl simply stares at him. Benny Badger overhears three coyotes discussing a plan to steal chickens from a nearby farm. Benny Badger is a short, heavy creature who doesn't travel far from home, so he doesn't always know what's going on in his neighborhood. Benny Badger meets an owl who tells him that somebody is home, and Benny says he will dig in as soon as he gets his breath.

Last chunk: eyed, and made no reply.  "I say, it's a fine evening!" Benny repeated in a louder tone.  "Very well!" the owl replied. "You may say it as often as you wish. I'msure I have no objection. . . . But you don't need to come any nearer,"he added.  Benny Badger stopped and squatted in the grass. He was glad to rest, forhe was--as has been said--no great traveller.  "Is anybody at home?" he asked presently.  "Somebody is," said the owl.  "Then I'll dig right in as soon as I get my breath," said Benny
