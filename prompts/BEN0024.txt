Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A competition is underway to win a silver arrow, and two of the best marksmen are Ben and Bab. However, when the old lady catches Ben's jacket and begins questioning him, it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard. The passage describes how the boys were surprised to discover that two of the girls could shoot better than them. Bab, one of the girls, said that a lady had taught her and that she was determined to beat all the boys. The passage describes the feeling of safety and comfort that the warm sunshine brings, which sets the person whistling cheerfully. In the morning, Mrs. Moss asked Ben how he slept and he said he slept well. He joked that he was used to sleeping on hay and a horse blanket, and that corn husks were actually good for young bones. The Moss family is sitting around the table, and the mother is questioning the son about where he came from. The little girls are sitting on the other side of the table, eager to hear the conversation.

Last chunk: go for the milk."  "Oh, Ma, do let us stay!  We'll never tell, truly, truly!" cried Bab and  Betty, full of dismay being sent off when secrets were about to be  divulged.  "I don't mind 'em," said Ben handsomely.  "Very well, only hold your tongues.  Now, boy where did you come from?"  said Mrs. Moss, as the little girls hastily sat down together on their  private and particular bench opposite their mother, brimming with  curiosity and beaming with satisfaction at the prospect before them.
