Story so far: The animals are discussing how they believe Buldeo will be able to find and kill the Devil-child (Mowgli). They are worried about the Wolf-demon, which they believe could appear at any time. Bagheera tells Mowgli that he will have to go back to the humans eventually, but Mowgli insists that he is not ready yet. Mother Wolf hides so that Buldeo cannot see her. Mowgli is happy that Buldeo is telling lies about her. The passage describes a woman who is crying at Mowgli's feet, but he quickly picks her up and she starts blessing him. Her husband looks on enviously and says that if they make it to Khanhiwara, he will sue the people who destroyed their crops and starved their buffaloes. The passage describes how a villager named Buldeo killed one of his own buffaloes after mistaking it for the Devil-child, and how the village plans to torture and burn Messua and her husband for being the child's parents. In the passage, Hathi the elephant is discussing with other animals the best way to destroy the fields of humans. He is reluctant to do so because of the bloodshed that would ensue, but the others convince him that it is necessary. In the end, they all agree to go ahead with the plan. Mowgli has killed Shere Khan and is now telling the Seeonee Pack that he will be hunting in the Jungle from now on.

Last chunk: and the sound,      The smell and the touch of the breed!      Fat black ash by the altar-stone,      Here is the white-foot rain,    And the does bring forth in the fields unsown,      And none shall affright them again;    And the blind walls crumble, unknown, o'erthrown      And none shall inhabit again!    You will remember that after Mowgli had pinned Shere Khan's hide to  the Council Rock, he told as many as were left of the Seeonee Pack that  henceforward he would hunt in the Jungle
