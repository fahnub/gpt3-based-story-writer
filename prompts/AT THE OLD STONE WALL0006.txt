Outline: Mr. Chippy is a small bird who lives in a wild grapevine near an old stone wall. One day, he is alarmed by a long, slim shape that darting from a chink in the wall. His neighbors begin to echo his warning notes, but young Master Robin scoffs at the idea that he could be in danger. Mr. Chippy's wife is away from home, so he continues to fly back and forth in a flutter.

Finally, Rusty Wren's wife gives a piercing scream, warning that Master Robin will be caught. Master Robin is indignant at being called fat and turns around to confront the speaker, only to find a snake right behind him!

Story so far:  Mr. Chippy is alarmed because his wife and children are away from home, but young Master Robin does not listen to his advice. Master Robin sees a mouse come out of a wall and go back in again. Mr. Chippy warns him that the mouse will get him, but Master Robin is not afraid. Master Robin is angry with Rusty Wren for warning him about Mr. Chippy's visitor. He thinks he can handle himself just as well as Rusty Wren can. However, he almost falls off his perch, showing that he is not as skilled as he thinks. Mr. Chippy is frightened by a snake and young Master Robin thinks it's funny. A piercing scream alerts young Master Robin that he is the subject of Mrs. Wren's ire. Robin is indignant at being called fat and turns to confront his accuser.

Last chunk: a piercing scream.  "That fat Robin boy--he'll be caught!" she wailed.  Now, it made Master Robin very angry to be spoken of in such a way as  that.  "Fat!" he burst out in a loud tone as he stared in Mrs. Wren's  direction. "Who's fat?"  "You are!" said a strange, grumpy voice right behind him--or so it  seemed to young Master Robin.
