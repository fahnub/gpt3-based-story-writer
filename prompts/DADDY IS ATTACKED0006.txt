Outline: Daddy Longlegs is out for a walk and pays a visit to his friend Rusty Wren. Unbeknownst to Daddy, there is an army of ants that live beneath the big cherry tree that Rusty calls home, and these ants have been planning to capture Daddy ever since he started eating their kin whenever he visited. 

The ants finally get their chance when Daddy falls into their trap and they swarm him, ready to capture him. daddy is terrified and screams for help, but Rusty has flown away to find food for his hungry children and doesn't hear him. The ants close in around Daddy and he thinks he's never been in such danger before.

Story so far:  The passage describes an army of ants attacking a man. The man is unable to escape and cries for help, but no one comes to his aid. The passage tells the story of how a Daddy Longlegs spider was saved from being eaten by ants by being allowed to climb a cherry tree. The ants then waited for him to come down, but he was able to make his way home safely. The army is closing in on Daddy Longlegs and he is very afraid.

Last chunk: seen him leave. And  they knew that they had nothing to fear from that quarter.  As the army closed in around him, Daddy Longlegs thought that he had  never been in such danger in all his life before. The army was so near  him that he could have seen the whites of the soldier's eyes--if they  had had any whites.
