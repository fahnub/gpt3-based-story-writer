Outline: Rusty Wren sees Miss Kitty Cat on top of his cherry tree and realizes she is about to attack his family's nest. He frantically tries to get her to leave, but she is determined to stay. The other birds in the area start to gather and call her names, but they can't get her to leave. Finally, little Mr. Chippy comes and tells Rusty that help is on the way. Miss Kitty Cat is startled by a meow and realizes that the help Mr. Chippy was referring to is a cat. She decides to leave and the birds are saved.

Story so far:  Birds are stuck on top of a house and Mr. Chippy says he knows someone who can help. Rusty Wren scolds Miss Kitty Cat, telling her to get off his roof and out of his cherry tree. Other feathered neighbors arrive and start calling Miss Kitty Cat names. Some of them even fly close to her, as if they're going to peck her eyes out. Miss Kitty starts to look worried, wondering where all these birds live.

Last chunk: "Go away!" Rusty Wren scolded. "Get off my roof! Get out of my cherry  tree!"  By this time feathered neighbors of the Wren family were arriving from  all directions. They didn't hesitate to call Miss Kitty Cat names. And  some of them even darted quite near her, as if they meant to peck her  eyes out.  Miss Kitty began to have a worried look.  "Goodness! Where do they all live?" she asked herself. "I had no idea  there were so many birds around here. There's better hunting than I  supposed."
