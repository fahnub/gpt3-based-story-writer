Outline: The blacksmith is shoeing a white mare when she becomes surprised to learn that he is not a colt. She then proceeds to gossip about him with the old horse Ebenezer. The blacksmith overhears their conversation and is disgusted with the mare. He shoos her away and she kicks him. The blacksmith is unharmed and Twinkleheels is determined to behave better than the mare.

Story so far:  The blacksmith crowds close to the white mare so her kick won't have room to get much power. The blacksmith is ready to shoe the pony and thinks he will be no trouble. The pony, Twinkleheels, decides to behave his best no matter what.

Last chunk: blacksmith, "I'm ready to shoe the pony. And if he's as  clever as he looks I shan't have a bit of trouble with him."  When he heard that, Twinkleheels made up his mind that he would behave  his best, no matter what happened.
