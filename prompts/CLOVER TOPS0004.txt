Outline: The Muley Cow noticed that Billy Woodchuck was making many trips back and forth across the pasture, and she saw that he always crept under the fence and stole into the field where the clover grew. The Muley Cow told him that the clover was not intended for him, but Billy Woodchuck continued to visit the clover-patch just as often as ever.

The Muley Cow told the rest of the herd that something will have to be done to keep that Woodchuck boy out of the clover, or there will be no nice clover hay for them next winter. The little red cow suggested that somebody ought to put a poke on him, but the Muley Cow thought it silly.

One of the Muley Cow's friends inquired if she had told Billy Woodchuck to keep out of the clover, and the Muley Cow replied that she had dropped a hint, but he can't take a hint.

Billy Woodchuck sat as still as a mouse and never took his eyes off her, which gave the Muley Cow a queer turn. The Muley Cow exclaimed that Billy Woodchuck must be ill and that the trouble is just that he's eaten too much clover.
