Outline: Brownie Beaver is out walking in the woods, trying to forget about the impending storm that is going to destroy his home. He comes across a clearing where loggers have been at work, and he is so angry at the sight of all the stolen trees that he doesn't even remember the storm. He trips on something and realizes that it is a chain that the loggers have left behind. He hurries back to his village and uses the chain to save his house from the storm. When the storm doesn't come, he is so excited that he forgets all about the trees and goes to bed.

Story so far:  Brownie finds a chain and ties it to his house to anchor it down in case a cyclone comes. Brownie Beaver is angry because loggers have chopped down many trees. Brownie Beaver notices that all the houses in his village are still standing, even though his house was the only one with a chain around it. He asks Tired Tim how this could be, and Tim tells him that the chain must have saved the whole village. The speaker says that there was no cyclone and that the beaver is upset and won't talk to anyone. Brownie Beaver finds a chain that the loggers had used to haul logs out of the woods, and he hurries back home to use it to chain down his house and save it from the wind. Grandaddy Beaver has predicted that there will be a great wind. Tired Tim, who has been digging a house in the bank near Grandaddy's, is surprised to find the old beaver behind him. Everyone agrees that Grandaddy is a fine, noble old gentleman, but they hope he is mistaken about the great wind. Brownie Beaver is happy he listened to Tired Tim and built a hideout in the bank, as his house would have been carried away by the big wind otherwise. Brownie Beaver finds a broken dam and is excited because he knows that Farmer Green is responsible.

Last chunk: suppose it's Farmer Green; for they say he'salways up to such tricks." He took a good look around. And then heturned to go back to the village and tell what he had discovered.  Just as he turned he tripped on something. And something clinkedbeneath his feet. It didn't sound like a stone. So Brownie Beaverlooked down to see what was there.  Now, in his anger he had quite forgotten the great storm. But as hesaw what had tripped him he remembered it again. But he was no longerworried.  "Hurrah!"
