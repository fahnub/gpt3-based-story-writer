Outline: The bays in the barn are annoyed with Twinkleheels the pony because they think he is a lazy loafer who is always eating. Twinkleheels tries to explain that his mealy nose doesn't mean he's been eating meal, but the bays don't believe him.

One day, the bays are forced to walk on the tread mill for thrashing, and they are not happy about it. Twinkleheels tries to talk to them, but the thrashing machine is too loud for them to hear him.

Johnnie Green comes to the field and feeds Twinkleheels some of the newly thrashed oats. The bays see this and they are envious.

One of the bays says to his mate, "That pony has begun to eat up the new oats already. I hoped he'd have the decency to decline them when Johnnie Green offered him a taste."

The bays think that Twinkleheels has been eating meal because he has a mealy nose, but he explains that his nose is just the color of meal and that he hasn't actually been eating it. The bays don't believe him. Ebenezer scolds the bays for being rude to Twinkleheels, and explains that mealy noses are not uncommon.

"Don't be rude to this pony!" the old horse Ebenezer chided them. "If  you had spent more of your time off the farm, and seen more horses,  you'd know that mealy noses like his are not uncommon. In my younger  days, when I went to the county fair every fall, I used to meet a great  many horses. And I learned then that mealy noses are by no
