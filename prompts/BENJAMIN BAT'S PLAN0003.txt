Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

The passage describes how two children went around to their neighbors to try and get some clothes for their beggar friend. In the end, they were successful and their friend emerged looking much better. Kiddie Katydid often sees Benjamin Bat out at night, and he knows that Benjamin is a night-prowler like himself. Kiddie lies low in his tree-top when he knows Benjamin is around, to give him plenty of time to satisfy his hunger.

Last chunk: Since Benjamin was another night-prowler like himself, Kiddie Katydid  saw him often. It seemed to Kiddie that he could scarcely ever gaze at  the full moon without catching sight of Benjamin Bat's dusky shape  flitting jerkily across the great, round, yellow disk.  When Benjamin was astir in the neighborhood, Kiddie Katydid lay low--or  high--in his favorite tree-top. At least, he kept very still until the  night was nearly gone, to give Benjamin Bat plenty of time to satisfy  his hunger. For
