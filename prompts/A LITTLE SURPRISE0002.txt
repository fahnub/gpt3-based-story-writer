Outline: The story is set in a poor, inner-city neighborhood, and revolves around the local Kindergarten. The protagonist is Patsy, a young boy who has been living a rough, tough life on the streets. Patsy is taken in by the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Kate, and quickly becomes devoted to her and the school. He takes on the role of caretaker and protector, and is a loyal and obedient student.

Patsy is also friends with Jim, another boy from the neighborhood. Jim is older than Patsy and is starting to get interested in girls. He tells Patsy that he wants to find a girl to marry, and Patsy helps him look.

One day, Patsy confides in Miss Kate that he is worried about what will happen to him when he has to leave the Kindergarten and go to "real school." Miss Kate reassures him and tells him that he is welcome to stay at the Kindergarten forever.

The story ends with Patsy and Jim getting married, and Miss Kate attending their wedding.

Story so far: This passage describes different children and animals the author has encountered. The children are all unique and special in their own ways, and the author enjoys seeing them happy. The animals are also well-behaved and liked by the other animals in the neighborhood. Dickie Deer Mouse is a skilled forager who is able to store up food during the summer and fall, so that he can survive the winter when food is scarce. He is also quicker and more agile than Frisky Squirrel, which allows him to out compete him for food. The passage describes the Muley Cow smelling something strange and wild, which scares her off. Johnnie Green doesn't notice and runs towards the source of the smell, only to be confronted by a shaggy creature. Dickie is a young bird who is well-bred and always clean. His feathered neighbors don't always like him, but they have to admit he's a spick-and-span young chap. The speaker is talking about how Jim is looking for a girl to marry, and how he will need to get money to take care of her. The passage describes a family in which the parents are busy working and the children are left to their own devices. Patsy and the narrator spend their time together making plans for the next day. The passage describes a boy's desire to go buffalo hunting, and how he imagines doing it. He thinks about how much more exciting it would be than staying in his boring hometown.

Last chunk: buffalo hunting (with  the Muley Cow for the buffalo). He wished he might try lassoing her from  the back of the old horse Ebenezer. But he hardly thought his father  would approve of the plan.  Well, Johnnie, the Muley Cow and Spot the dog were in the back pasture  one day, where the Muley Cow had strayed. And as Johnnie paused to pick  a few blackberries he thought what a humdrum place Pleasant Valley was,  anyway, and how he would like to go off where there were real buffaloes,  and Indians,
