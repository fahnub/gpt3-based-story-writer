Outline: The flock of sheep are running away from a bear, with Snowball leading the way. They jump over a stone wall into a tangle of berry bushes, where Snowball is confronted by the bear. He runs back over the wall to safety, with the rest of the flock following close behind.

Story so far:  Aunt Nancy is scolding Snowball for disturbing Uncle Jerry Chuck's rest with their recent wild scramble. Snowball is trying to escape the sheep, and the foremost of the oncoming flock of sheep sees him.

Last chunk: Snowball gave a frightened, frantic blat. The next instant he was  scrambling back over the wall.  The foremost of the oncoming flock of sheep saw him. They couldn't think  what had happened. Anyhow, they couldn't stop. Close behind them pressed  the flock, all bunched together and hurrying blindly on.
