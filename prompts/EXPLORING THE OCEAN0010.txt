Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far:  The barnacles are singing a nonsensical song, and Trot thinks it's stupid. The mermaids quietly rebuked the guests for arguing and being noisy, and reminded them that the queen's guests should be more careful. The dinner provided was delicious, with lobster soup, fried salmon, and oysters, among other seafood dishes. The mermaid warns Cap'n Bill and Trot to watch out for the snapping eels. The eels are very active and can be dangerous. The barnacles sing about how they were attached to a man-o'-war, but it ran away and went to sea. They were then gathered up by a halibut and taken to topsy-turvy land. The mermaids' guests found the meal very satisfying, and there was no danger of them being hungry while they remained the guests of the mermaids. The meal ended with ice cream, which surprised the child guests, since they thought it would be impossible to get ice at the bottom of the sea. The passage describes a meal with unknown dishes, which the child is suspicious of. Cap'n Bill eats everything without questioning it, so the child decides to do the same. Trot and Cap'n Bill learn that the ice cream they are eating comes from icebergs. Trot is ashamed of how much she ate, but the queen assures her that it is okay. Aquareine then sends them out for a swim.

Last chunk: freeze it," Trot replied.  "It is brought to us from the icebergs that float in the northern  parts of the ocean," explained Merla.  "O' course, Trot. You orter thought o' that. I did," said Cap'n  Bill.  The little girl was glad there was no more to eat, for she was  ashamed to feel she had eaten every morsel she could. Her only  excuse for being so greedy was that "ev'rything tasted just  splendid!" as she told the queen.  "And now," said Aquareine, "I will send you out for a swim with  Merla,
