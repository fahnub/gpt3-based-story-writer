Outline: Dickie Deer Mouse is waiting impatiently for Mr. Pine Finch to drop another bud out of the tree-top when he suddenly realizes that Mr. Pine Finch is much more careful than he thought and that he might only drop a bud once a year. However, a small shower of buds comes rattling down upon the snow-crust and Dickie Deer Mouse eagerly grabs them all up and eats them.

Mr. Pine Finch is surprised to see Dickie Deer Mouse still beneath the tree and he tells him that he must go now but that he can find him there almost any morning soon after daybreak. Dickie Deer Mouse goes home and sleeps soundly before returning the next morning with his eighteen cousins.

Mr. Pine Finch looks queerer than ever when he sees that Dickie has brought eighteen of his relations with him, but he bade them all good morning and dropped an enormous number of buds. Dickie Deer Mouse and his family decide that Mr. Pine Finch is the best friend they have in all Pleasant Valley.

The breakfast parties beneath Mr. Pine Finch's favorite tree come to an end when the snow melts and warm weather makes the underground chamber in Farmer Green's pasture seem stuffy. Dickie Deer Mouse says farewell to his eighteen cousins and sets off to look for a pleasant place to spend the summer.

Story so far:  Dickie Deer Mouse is happy to have found a spot where Mr. Pine Finch drops buds that he can eat. He goes home and sleeps well, and the next morning he is followed by his eighteen cousins.

Last chunk: he flew  off.  Dickie Deer Mouse told himself that he was in luck. By coming to that  spot early every day he could pick up buds enough--dropped carelessly by  Mr. Pine Finch--to feed himself until spring came and the snow melted  and uncovered the ground, where he knew he could find food.  So he went home and slept as he had not slept for weeks. And the next  morning, when he went back to the tree where he had found Mr. Pine  Finch, his eighteen cousins followed him.
