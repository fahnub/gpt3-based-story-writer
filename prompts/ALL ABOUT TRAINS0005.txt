Outline: Mrs. Ladybug tells Freddie Firefly that he should spend his nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the trains. Freddie is hesitant at first, but Mrs. Ladybug assures him that he will be able to stop the trains before they run over him. Freddie decides to try it out and sets off for the railroad track. When he gets there, he waves his light in front of an oncoming train. The train does not stop and Freddie is killed.

Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug tells Freddie Firefly that he should stop worrying and start working if he doesn't want to waste his time. Freddie is doubtful about whether he can fly all the way to the railroad, but Mrs. Ladybug insists that he can. Freddie Firefly liked Mrs. Ladybug's idea, and though he knew she was mistaken about some things, he began to think she was quite wise. A man sees a ladybug and waves at her as he walks towards the village. In this fable, Freddie Firefly asks little Mrs. Ladybug what could happen if the wind blew out his light. Mrs. Ladybug replies that the train would strike him and be wrecked. She explains that she has everything planned for him, and that he will spend his nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the trains. A firefly is telling a moth how easy it is to catch a train, but the moth is worried that the train might not stop in time. Mrs. Ladybug tells Freddie Firefly that it is not his or her concern what the trains do after they stop. Freddie agrees to try her advice just this once.

Last chunk: best," Freddie Firefly told Mrs. Ladybug at last.  "I'll take your advice just this once, and I'll see how I like the work.  But there's another question I'd like to ask you: What will the trains  do after they stop?"  While laughing over Freddie's question Mrs. Ladybug shook so hard that  she unravelled sixteen rows of her knitting before she could stop.  "Bless you!" she cried, as soon as she could speak. "I don't know what  the trains will do. That's their affair--not yours nor mine.
