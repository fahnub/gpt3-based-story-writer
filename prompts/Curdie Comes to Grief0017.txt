Outline: Curdie is a miner who lives in a small town at the base of a mountain. One day, he is sent to the mountain to fetch some ore for the blacksmith. On his way there, he meets a strange old woman who tells him that the mountain is full of goblins. Curdie doesn't believe her at first, but when he arrives at the mountain, he sees a goblin himself. He tries to catch it, but it disappears into a hole in the mountain.

Curdie decides to watch the hole to see if the goblin comes out. He does this every night, and eventually sees a whole group of goblins emerge from the hole. They start digging in a different direction, so Curdie follows them. He soon realizes that they are tunneling their way towards the king's house.

Curdie decides to warn the king, but he is captured by the king's men-at-arms before he can reach him. They accuse him of being a thief and lock him up in a room in the house. Curdie is injured in the leg during his capture, and his wound becomes infected. He starts to rave and talk incoherently about the goblins.

The king's nurse, who was present when Curdie first met the princess, overhears him talking and realizes that he is telling the truth. She goes to the king and tells him what Curdie has said. The king orders his men to release Curdie and to listen to what he has to say.

Curdie tells the king about the goblins and their plans to tunnel into the house. The king orders his men to stop them. They dig a trench around the house and fill it with water, which stops the goblins from getting any closer.

The king decides to reward Curdie for his bravery. He gives him a job in the palace and he also allows him to marry the princess. Curdie and the princess live happily ever after.

Story so far:  Curdie is approached by the king's men-at-arms, who want to know what he was up to. Curdie agrees to tell them, but only if they promise to listen and not do anything rash. Curdie begins to suspect that the goblins are no longer mining, but are instead tunneling horizontally. He watches them closely and one night sees them begin to ascend a slope of hard rock. The passage describes how a goblin was startled by a noise and then tried to hide. The passage describes a man recounting the events of the previous night to a soldier, who does not believe him. A true princess is always uneasy until she has the opportunity to confess her wrongdoings and throw the wrongness away from her. Curdie spends a night in the king's garden, observing. A boy is wounded by a crossbow bolt and captured by men-at-arms. The men are amazed to find that it is only a boy, and not a demon. The boy is then asked what he is doing there. Curdie is sick, and the people around him do not believe him. They promise to do everything he wants, but have no intention of actually fulfilling those promises.

Last chunk: Curdie dreadfully, who now felt in his turn what it was not to be  believed, and the consequence was that his fever returned, and by the  time when, at his persistent entreaties, the captain was called, there  could be no doubt that he was raving.  They did for him what they  could, and promised everything he wanted, but with no intention of  fulfilment.  At last he went to sleep, and when at length his sleep  grew profound and peaceful, they left him, locked the door again, and  withdrew,
