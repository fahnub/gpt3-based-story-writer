Story so far:  Ben arrives on a pretty mare, and the admiring boys and girls are allowed to gather around him. He doesn't look much like the god of love now, but he's still praised by the kids. Ben is embarrassed after he is found wearing a crown and slippers in the garden and quickly makes an excuse to leave. Lita and Ben are enjoying a horse race together.

He is glad to be going back to his normal life of school and kind people. This passage describes a school play being put on for the children, with one of the teachers dressing the actresses for the tragedy.
