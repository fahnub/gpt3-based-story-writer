Outline: Turkey Proudfoot is in the farmyard when he hears a strange gobbling noise. He is worried that he made the noise himself, but the rooster assures him that he did not. The gobbling noise happens again, and Turkey Proudfoot is convinced that there is another turkey around.

He goes to the farmhouse to investigate and finds a green bird in a cage who is making the noise. The bird introduces itself as Polly and Turkey Proudfoot is not impressed. He tries to attack the bird, but ends up getting scolded by the hired man.

Turkey Proudfoot sulks behind the barn, muttering about the bird. He is angry that the bird is called Pretty Polly when he thinks it should be called Turkey Bird.

Story so far:  Turkey Proudfoot is upset because he thinks the bird that imitates him should be called a Turkey Bird, but instead it's called Pretty Polly. Turkey Proudfoot hears a gobbling sound and is worried that it might be him. He asks the rooster if he made the sound, but the rooster says no. Turkey Proudfoot is surprised to find a green bird in a cage on the piazza. The bird tells Turkey Proudfoot that its name is Polly and that it wants a cracker. Turkey Proudfoot is looking for the source of a gobbling noise, and the rooster suggests that the culprit is hiding in the chimney. Turkey Proudfoot is going to fly to the top of the house to catch the rooster. The rooster is delighted and calls for all the hens to come watch.

The rooster promptly called to all the hens to "come quick,"
