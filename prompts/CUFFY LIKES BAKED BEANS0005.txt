Outline: Cuffy Bear finds Farmer Green's lunch basket and eats everything inside, including a pot of baked beans. He enjoys them so much that he wishes the pot was bigger. When he's finished, he finds that the pot is stuck to his nose. He tries to remove it, but can't, so he decides to go home. His family laughs at him and his mother is happy to get the iron pot. Cuffy escapes being punished.

Story so far:  Cuffy feels uncomfortable and wonders how he will ever get rid of the pot over his nose. He is puzzled by the thought of how he will be able to eat again. When he reaches home, his family is very worried about him. Mr. Bear pulls the bean-pot off his son's nose, and Cuffy is himself again. Cuffy Bear finds Farmer Green's lunch basket and eats everything in it, including the custard pie. He then finds a small iron pot and tips it over, revealing baked beans. He eats them all up, leaving a mess. Cuffy is stuck in an iron pot and can't get out. He grunts and growls, but it doesn't scare the pot off his nose.

Last chunk: still stuck on  his nose as fast as ever.  Cuffy grunted. He couldn't really have said anything, with his mouth  deep in the iron pot. So he just grunted in a pouting sort of way; and  then he gave the pot a sharp rap against a rock. That hurt his nose. And  this time he growled--as well as he could. But all his grunting and  growling didn't frighten the bean-pot the slightest bit. There it  stayed, perched on his nose just as if it would never come off.  All this time the mowing-machine kept up
