Outline: Snowball, a sheep, is knocked down by a black ram and decides he must be sheared. He goes to the pasture to find his old companions, but they are so changed by shearing that he can't tell who is who. He grins at them, and the big old dame scolds him, telling him he will be sheared too. Farmer Green comes in and Johnnie Green says he wants to shear Snowball himself. They go to the barn, but Johnnie decides to go fishing instead and Snowball is left un-sheared. The next morning, Johnnie comes back and corrals Snowball, leading him to the barn to be sheared. The black ram and the other sheep wait at the pasture bars for Snowball to return, but he comes back without his fleece.

Story so far:  Snowball sees his old companions, but they are so changed by shearing that he doesn't recognize them. He stands and grins at them. Snowball is worried that he will be sheared, but Aunt Nancy reassures him that he will have a chance to laugh at himself later. Johnnie Green doesn't want his father to shear Snowball, because he wants to do it himself. In the morning, Snowball found that he had been mistaken and Johnnie Green had caught him. The speaker is Aunt Nancy Ewe, a fat, wrinkled old lady with a scrawny neck. Snowball has never seen a sheared flock before and laughs in Aunt Nancy's face. The black ram announced that Snowball was back in the pasture, and Aunt Nancy Ewe confirmed that he was indeed unshorn. This caused consternation among the other sheep, who couldn't imagine what had happened. Snowball refuses to be sheared, declaring that Johnnie Green's "to-morrow" means "never."

Last chunk: I'll do it to-morrow."  Then Farmer Green and Johnnie went away. And they hadn't passed the  bars when a great uproar broke out. The whole flock crowded around  Snowball. And everybody except him said, "_Baa!_"  "He laughs best who laughs last," Aunt Nancy remarked to him. "To-morrow  we'll laugh best--at you!"  But Snowball stood his ground and shook his head.  "I'm not going to be sheared," he declared. "I guess you don't know what  Johnnie Green's 'to-morrow' means. . . . It means 'never!'"
