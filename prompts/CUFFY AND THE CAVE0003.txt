Outline: Nimble, a young Spike Horn, befriends Cuffy Bear, a famous boxer who lives near Blue Mountain. One day, Cuffy invites Nimble to see his new home, a cave he's been eyeing up the mountain. Nimble is hesitant at first, but decides to go inside and wait for Cuffy while he looks around. As time goes on, Nimble starts to worry as the cave grows darker and snow begins to fall. He calls out for Cuffy, but there's no answer. Finally, he musters up the courage to go into the cave to look for him. Once inside, he finds Cuffy fast asleep. He wakes him up and they hurry down the mountain before the storm gets worse.

Story so far:  Cuffy Bear and Nimble have a conversation about caves. Cuffy Bear wants to go inside a cave, but Nimble doesn't want to go in. Nimble waits outside while Cuffy Bear goes in to look around. Cuffy Bear goes into a cave and Nimble waits for him outside. Nimble gets impatient and wishes Cuffy would hurry. Cuffy Bear shows Nimble a cave that he is thinking of moving into. Nimble the deer is being chased by a dog, so he climbs up a mountain to lose the dog. He then meets Cuffy Bear, who asks him where he lives. Nimble says he's not sure.

Nimble had stopped for a drink at the spring which marked the beginning  of Broad Brook and there he met Cuffy Bear, who was just turning away  from the ice-framed pool. "Aren't you a long way from home?" Cuffy asked  him.  "Yes! But I can get down to my favorite ridge quickly enough, when I  want to," said Nimble. "Do you live in this neighborhood?"  "I'm not quite sure,"
