Outline: Dorothy and her friends are sitting in the throne room of the royal palace in the Emerald City, awaiting the arrival of the invited guests for Ozma's birthday celebration. The first to arrive are the gingerbread man, King Dough the First, and his head booleywag (a child-like creature), Chick the Cherub, followed by a rubber bear. They are all from the Kingdoms of Hiland and Loland and Dorothy introduces them to the others.

Next to arrive is a tall, beautiful woman clad in an exquisite trailing gown - the Sorceress known as Glinda the Good. She is warmly welcomed by all and escorted to her room by fifty servants.

Then comes Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T.E., head professor at the Royal College of Oz, who wishes to read an Ode he has composed in honor of Ozma's birthday; but the Scarecrow won't let him.
