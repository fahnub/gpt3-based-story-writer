Outline: Turkey Proudfoot is a barnyard fowl who likes to range over the fields in search of food. One day, he strays into the woods and comes across a beech tree. He starts to eat the nuts on the ground when he hears a loud thumping sound. He realizes that it is coming from a short-necked, feathered gentleman sitting on a log and decides to investigate.

The gentleman is Mr. Grouse, who is drumming on the log in anticipation of a friend. When he sees Turkey Proudfoot, he is disappointed and tells him to go home. Turkey Proudfoot is indignant and orders Mr. Grouse to call his friend so that he can show her a tail that is a tail. Mr. Grouse is unimpressed and tells Turkey Proudfoot that he is just a barnyard fowl who knows nothing about game birds.

When Turkey asks for the stranger's name, he is shocked to learn that it is Mr. Grouse, a famous drummer whose drumming is known throughout the valley. Turkey Proudfoot likes to explore and one day he finds a beech tree with nuts. Turkey Proudfoot is looking for beechnuts when he hears Johnnie Green drumming. He initially pays it no mind but then realizes that Johnnie is drumming in the woods because his mother wouldn't let him do it near the farmhouse. This passage discusses the expectations for those who want to learn about game birds. Turkey Proudfoot mutters that Johnnie Green must be eating most of the time, or he'd drum oftener. Turkey Proudfoot decides to join Johnnie Green in hopes of finding more beechnuts. Turkey Proudfoot eventually finds Johnnie Green sitting on a log in a clearing. Turkey Proudfoot is hiding behind a bush, watching a short-necked gentleman with a tail spread out in the same way that Turkey often carries his own tail. Turkey plans to show the stranger a real tail, so he steps out from behind the bush, spreads his tail, and snaps a dry twig beneath his weight. When the stranger hears the noise and turns to look, he briefly has an eager look on his face, but when he sees Turkey Proudfoot, he is no longer interested.

Last chunk: short-necked gentleman with a  tail spread in much the fashion in which Turkey Proudfoot so often  carried his own.  Turkey Proudfoot drew back behind a bush, out of sight.  "I'll show that bird a tail that _is_ a tail," he muttered to himself.  So he spread his tail and then stepped proudly forth. A dry twig snapped  beneath his weight. At that sound the stranger on the log turned his  head quickly. Just for an instant there was an eager look on his face.  But when he beheld Turkey Proudfoot it
