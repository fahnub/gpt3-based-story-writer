Outline: Johnnie Green and his grandmother are on their way to the miller's to get the wheat ground into flour when their horse, Ebenezer, breaks a strap on his harness and they nearly go tumbling down a hill. Johnnie finds a piece of string in his pocket to tie the harness back together and they continue on their way. When they reach the bottom of the hill, Johnnie's grandmother screams - she had felt something run up her back and jump off her shoulder, which turns out to be a chipmunk. The chipmunk had been in the sack of wheat and must have gotten in Johnnie's pocket when he was taking the string out. Sandy, the chipmunk, is glad to be out of the sack of wheat and sets off to find his way home.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green's grandmother reports seeing a chipmunk, and Johnnie is not interested. Johnnie's grandmother needs a piece of string to mend the harness, but Johnnie can't find any in his pockets. Johnnie Green's grandmother screams when the horse steps on stones in the road. Johnnie Green ties the harness together after his grandmother screams. Old Ebenezer had been pulling a wagon for many years before Johnnie Green was born. Johnnie tugged on the reins, but Ebenezer continued slowly down the hill. When they reached the bottom, Ebenezer looked at Johnnie as if to say, "I've brought you and your grandma down safely. Now you can get out of the wagon if you want to." Johnnie then jumped out.

Last chunk: for he had been pulling a wagon for almost  twenty years before Johnnie Green was born.  Johnnie tugged hard upon the reins. But still old Ebenezer went on  picking his way even more slowly. And he never stopped until he reached  the bottom of the hill. Then he stood stock still; and he looked around  at Johnnie Green, as if to say, "There, young man! I've brought you and  your grandma safe down that hill. And _now_ I'll let you get out of the  wagon, if you want to."  Well, Johnnie Green jumped
