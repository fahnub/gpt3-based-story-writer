Outline: It's wintertime and Cuffy Bear and his sister Silkie are excited to play in the snow. They have a blast playing tag and hide-and-seek and somersaults, and they also eat a lot of chestnuts. Cuffy Bear, being the greediest, eats the most and soon gets a pain in his stomach.

Mrs. Bear scolds him and tells him to pick up all the chestnut shells on the floor. Cuffy and Silkie start yawning and before long, they both fall asleep. Mrs. Bear smiles and takes them to their bedchamber, covering them with leaves so they'll be warm. That night, Mrs. Bear and Mr. Bear go to bed early too.

The next day, no one in the family wakes up. They all just sleep and sleep throughout the entire winter.

Story so far:  The passage describes children playing in the snow in winter. Their footprints look like those of barefooted children. They eat a lot of chestnuts. Cuffy Bear's sister Silkie had a birthday party when it first snowed, and Cuffy and Silkie played in the snow every day after that. The passage describes how two bears, Silkie and Cuffy, fall asleep after yawning. Silkie falls asleep before she finishes picking up her shells, and Cuffy falls asleep after he cleans the floor. Mrs. Bear finds them both asleep. Mrs. Bear covers her children with leaves to keep them warm before they go into hibernation for the winter.

Last chunk: when she came back into the room. She smiled as  she saw them. And picking up first one and then the other she carried  them into their little bed-chamber and put them down gently and covered  them over with leaves, so they would be snug and warm. Yes, Mrs. Bear  wanted her children to be warm, for she knew that they would not wake up  again until spring. She had noticed for several days that Cuffy and  Silkie were growing sleepy. And to tell the truth, Mrs. Bear was  becoming sleepy herself.
