Outline: Rusty Wren is a small bird who is very happy to have found a bunch of tobacco leaves in the carriage house on the farm. He goes home to get his wife so she can see it too, but she is uninterested. She shows him an egg in their nest and he is very happy, singing to her. They never mention the tobacco again.

Story so far:  Rusty Wren is angry with his wife for buying tobacco, but he soon realizes that he left the tobacco upstairs in the carriage house. This passage describes a moment when Rusty Wren peered into a bird's nest and found a large egg. He was so surprised and happy that he started singing. His wife seemed pleased, and from then on she stopped smoking. Rusty Wren was not afraid to enter any of the farm buildings, unlike old Mr. Crow. There was no reason for Rusty the rat to fly through the open window into the farmhouse, beyond the fact that he liked to prowl around and see what he could find. Once he was inside, he noticed something that had not caught his eye on his former visit: a cat hanging from a rafter. Rusty Wren returns home to find his wife sitting on their nest. She shows him something new - their eggs have hatched and there are now baby birds in the nest. Rusty Wren feels much better after eating three dozen insects and sings a few songs in thanks to the sun before it sets. Meanwhile, Farmer Green is still working in the fields.

Last chunk: ALL'S WELL AGAIN (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    After Rusty Wren had revived his drooping spirits by eating  heartily of three dozen insects of different kinds and sizes, he  felt so cheerful that he couldn't help trilling a few songs. It was  almost evening; and he was glad not to let the sun go down without  thanking him in that way for shining so brightly all day.  Though it was so late, Farmer Green still toiled in the fields; but  Rusty could hear Johnnie and old dog Spot driving the cows down
