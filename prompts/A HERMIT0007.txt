Outline: The Hermit Thrush is not pleased when Bobby Bobolink moves to Cedar Swamp at haying time. The Hermit is a quiet gentleman who prefers to spend his time in a thicket on the edge of the swamp. He has a beautiful, sweet song, which he sings in a calm, unruffled fashion when he thinks nobody is near. The Hermit loathes noisy, boisterous people. And he dislikes loud clothes, too--no matter who wears them. He has even been known to speak in a slighting way of his cousin, Jolly Robin, not only because he is so sprightly and cheerful, but because he always wears a red waistcoat.

The Hermit himself clings to more sober colors. His coat is olive-brown, his tail somewhat paler in hue, and his waistcoat of quite a light shade, spotted with black.

As a rule he has little to say to his neighbors. But soon after Bobby Bobolink came to the swamp to live the Hermit began to talk more freely. He began to make complaints, saying that he had chosen Cedar Swamp as a quiet place to live and it was upsetting to him to have any one as harum-scarum as Bobby Bobolink settle in the neighborhood.

And one day the Hermit even spoke to Bobby Bobolink himself and took him to task, although nobody had introduced Bobby to him. And generally the Hermit wouldn't speak to anybody who hadn't made his acquaintance like that.

"Young man!" said the Hermit solemnly, when he chanced to meet the newcomer near the thicket where the Hermit lived, "I'm going to give you a bit of advice. I'm going to warn you that if you don't behave differently you'll come to some bad end."

Now, Bobby Bobolink supposed that of course the speaker was only joking. He knew that some people could joke when they wore a long face. So he laughed heartily. And thinking what a jolly chap the stranger in the spotted waistcoat was, he began to sing.

"There you go!" the Hermit exclaimed as a look of pain crossed his refined face. "You can't even keep still long enough to hear a little valuable advice. Do stop that annoying noise of yours and listen to what I have to say!"

Bobby Bobolink was so

Story so far:  The passage describes a person who is singing very loudly and passionately, to the point where they might explode. The speaker warns that if this happens, all that will be left of the singer will be a cloud of feathers.

Last chunk: frenzy of song you're going to explode? And  then there'll be nothing left of you except a cloud of feathers!"
