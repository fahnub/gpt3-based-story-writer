Outline: Jasper Jay is a blue-coated bully who has a problem with people being too quiet. He especially doesn't like Mr. Chippy, a little bird who minds his own business and doesn't make a lot of noise. One day, Jasper decides to fly over to the stone wall where Mr. Chippy lives and tell him what he thinks of him.

Mr. Chippy emerges from the wild grapevine he lives in, and Jasper immediately starts in on him, telling him he's too quiet and needs to be more outgoing and happy. Mr. Chippy tries to please Jasper, but he's so upset that he can only manage a feeble "chip, chip, chip, chip."

Jasper gets angry and threatens to break every bone in Mr. Chippy's body if he doesn't start laughing. Mr. Chippy decides he's had enough, and with one swift movement, he knocks Jasper off the stone wall and back into the grass.

Jasper is furious, but Mr. Chippy has already dived back under the cover of the grapevine and is hiding between the stones. Jasper gives up and flies off, grumbling to himself. As he does, he thinks he hears a peculiar noise coming from the depths of the grapevine. It's Mr. Chippy, chuckling to himself.

Last chunk: one could hardly say that he looked pleased. Like  most people, he was not overjoyed by Jasper Jay's visits. But he crept  on top of the stone wall and _chipped_ a how-dy-do to his caller.  "That's no way to greet anybody!" cried Jasper Jay, rudely. "If you want  to make a person feel that he is welcome you ought to speak up good and  loud--and slap him on the back. And you must look happy, too."  Little Mr. Chippy smiled faintly.
