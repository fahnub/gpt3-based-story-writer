Story so far: The passage describes the characters' reactions to the news that the world is ending. Peter is despairing, Cecily is practical, and Sara Ray is regretful. Sara is worried that the paper might have gotten the time wrong for the event tomorrow, and Cecily tries to comfort her. Cecily is angry with Felicity for suggesting that the vase she received from her Aunt Olivia will be of no use to her. The passage discusses how people often reflect on what they would have done differently if they had known that Judgment Day was coming. Felicity expresses regret for the ways she treated her friend Sara the week before, and says she would have been much nicer if she had known that Judgment Day was approaching. The passage is about the conviction that what is read in the newspaper must be true, and how that affects people. Cecily gives Sara her prized forget-me-not jug to make up for not having a white dress to wear. The passage describes the author's feelings of guilt and dread before a court of their own conscience, thinking of all the wrong things they had done in their life.
