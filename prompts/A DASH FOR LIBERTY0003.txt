Outline: Trot is dreaming that she is at home in her bed, but she is cold and unable to move. She realizes that she is frozen inside of a block of ice and wakes up. She sees that the mermaid queen, Aquareine, is also frozen and realizes that their enemy, Zog, has frozen them while they slept. Trot decides that the only way to escape is to wait for the queen to melt the ice around them. The queen does so and they are able to swim to Cap'n Bill's room. They find that he is almost frozen and they have to rub him to bring him back to life. The queen and Clia decide that they need to leave the castle and they swim for the opening in the dome. They are followed by scores of sea devils, but they are able to make it through the opening and escape.

Story so far: Captain Bill and Trot are talking to the Queen and Princess Clia about the Arctic. The Queen and Princess Clia tell them that they can stay in the palace. Trot decides to leave the castle to find a way to help Captain Bill and the Queen. The Queen uses her magic power to melt the ice, and Trot and Clia rub Cap'n Bill's hands, nose, and ears to warm him up. After breaking a hole in a glass dome with a sword, a group of people swim through the opening and find themselves in an underwater castle. The Queen of the mermaids tells Trot that they will try to escape their captors, and that she is willing to risk everything for their safety. Trot is courageous and tells the Queen that she is ready to face whatever comes. Aquareine, the mermaid queen, is imprisoned in a block of ice, unable to move her arms or legs. Trot, a human girl, is also imprisoned in the ice, and she can see the queen clearly.

Last chunk: short time,  for only a tiny air space remained between their bodies and the ice,  and this air was like that of a winter day when the thermometer is  below zero.  Across the room Trot could see the mermaid queen lying on her couch,  for the solid ice was clear as crystal. Aquareine was imprisoned  just as Trot was, and although she held her fairy wand in one hand  and the golden sword in the other, she seemed unable to move either  of them, and the girl remembered that the queen always waved
