Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard.

Last chunk: shot came, and just missed  the bull's-eye by being in a hurry.  Bab and Ben each had one turn more; and, as they were about even, that  last arrow would decide the victory. Both had sent a shot into the  bull's-eye, but neither was exactly in the middle; so there was room to  do better, even, and the children crowded round, crying eagerly, "Now,  Ben!" "Now, Bab!" "Hit her up, Ben!" "Beat him, Bab!" while Thorny  looked as anxious as if the fate of the country depended on the success  of his
