Outline: Once there was a king who had a daughter of remarkable beauty and he named her Fairer-than-a-Fairy. Unknowingly, this name called down the jealousy of the fairies and they resolved to take revenge on the child. The eldest fairy, Lagree, was tasked with taking the child and she did so by kidnapping her and taking her to a hidden underground palace.

The child was seven years old at the time and Lagree kept her there for years, under strict orders never to let the fire in the grate go out. One day, while the child was admiring a rainbow, she heard a voice coming from it and it turned out to be a young man who had been imprisoned in the palace by Lagree. The two of them fell in love and met often, but one day Lagree found out that the fire had gone out and she was furious.

Lagree ordered the child to go and get fire from a nearby monster, Locrinos, who was known to eat young girls. The child went, but was saved by Locrinos's wife who was charmed by her. The child made it back safely and Lagree was even more furious.

Lagree pursued the child, but she was saved by her pet dog and cat who fought off Lagree. The child continued to run and came across a wood full of sweet scents and a silver castle suspended in the air. She went inside and found her love, Prince Rainbow, asleep on a couch.

Fairer-than-a-Fairy woke him and they were reunited. The Queen, Prince Rainbow's mother, was overjoyed to see her son and they all returned to the kingdom. The wedding was celebrated and they lived happily ever after.
