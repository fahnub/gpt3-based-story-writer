Outline: Nimble is a young deer who is determined to try carrots for himself, after his mother tells him how delicious they are. He sets off for the carrot patch one night, but is waylaid by Jimmy Rabbit, who is busy eating cabbages. Jimmy reluctantly shows Nimble to the carrot patch, and then scampers off.

Nimble is disappointed to find that carrots are not as tasty as he was led to believe. He starts to leave the patch, but is pursued by Jimmy Rabbit, who is being chased by a dog. Nimble and Jimmy lose each other in the woods, and Nimble goes home empty-handed.

The next day, Nimble's mother scolds him for not digging up the carrots to eat them, and he realizes his mistake. He insists that it wouldn't have made a difference anyway, because there was no moon out that night - a requirement for truly enjoying carrots, according to his mother.

Story so far:  Nimble is upset because he dug up carrots by moonlight, but then realizes that they wouldn't have tasted good anyway because there was no moon last night. Jimmy Rabbit and Nimble meet and then lose each other in the woods. Nimble tells his mother about the carrots he found in the woods. Nimble ate only the leaves of the carrots and his mother gave him a queer look. Jimmy Rabbit is being chased by a dog and runs past Nimble Deer, who is disappointed with the carrots he is eating. Nimble never reached Farmer Green's carrot patch once, but he promised himself he would as soon as he was big enough. Jimmy Rabbit shows Nimble where the carrot patch is and tells him to help himself. Nimble is a Spike Horn who steals down to Farmer Green's garden one night and finds Jimmy Rabbit eating a cabbage. Nimble asks Jimmy Rabbit if the carrots are good, and Jimmy Rabbit nods. Nimble then tastes a few of them and likes them.

Last chunk: come down to try the carrots," said Nimble.  Jimmy Rabbit made no reply, except to nod his head slightly. He was  eating so fast that he really couldn't speak just then.  "Are these carrots?" Nimble inquired, as he looked about at the big  cabbages, which crossed the garden in long rows.  Jimmy Rabbit shook his head.  "They seem to be good," said Nimble, "whatever they are. I'll taste of  one."  And he did. In fact he tasted of three or four of them, eating their  centers out neatly.  Meanwhile
