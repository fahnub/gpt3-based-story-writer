Outline: Mr. Nighthawk approaches Kiddie Katydid with the hopes of seeing the insect jump, but Kiddie Katydid is uninterested. Kiddie Katydid tells Mr. Nighthawk that his family and friends have all left and he does not know where they are. Mr. Nighthawk then pressures Kiddie Katydid into finding Katy, another katydid, to jump for him instead. Kiddie Katydid slyly tells Mr. Nighthawk that Katy did something, but does not elaborate, and Mr. Nighthawk is left to wonder what Katy did. Kiddie Katydid then informs Mr. Nighthawk that Solomon Owl, who likes to eat chickens, often visits the farm buildings. Mr. Nighthawk is frightened and flies away.

Story so far:  The passage describes Mr. Nighthawk's attempt to get Kiddie Katydid to call one of his family members so that he can eat them. Kiddie Katydid replies that he does not know where his relatives are. Kiddie refuses to show Mr. Nighthawk how to do a jump, saying only that Katy did it.

"Don't you suppose you could find _her_ and persuade _her_ to  do a little jumping for me--just to show me how it's done?"  "I'm sorry--" Kiddie said somewhat stiffly, "I'm sorry; but I must  absolutely refuse to do such a thing. Now that you've mentioned her,  I'll simply say _Katy did_. And beyond that I cannot discuss her with  you."  "She did what?" Mr. Nighthawk
