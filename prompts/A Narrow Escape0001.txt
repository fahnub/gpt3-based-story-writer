Outline: Jimmy Rabbit is sitting on top of a pile of vegetables in a wheelbarrow, being pushed by Frisky Squirrel. Jimmy is teasing Frisky, telling him that he's not strong enough to push the wheelbarrow. This makes Frisky determined to get the wheelbarrow up the hill to Jimmy's house. He finally makes it and Jimmy hops off. Frisky is so tired, he falls asleep.

The next day, Jimmy asks Billy Woodchuck to push the wheelbarrow for him. Billy does, and Jimmy has a free ride home. This continues for a while, with Jimmy's friends taking turns pushing the wheelbarrow. But eventually, all of Jimmy's friends stop coming around, until the only one left is Fatty Coon.

Jimmy doesn't like Fatty, but he agrees to let him push the wheelbarrow. Fatty is strong and doesn't get tired easily. But after a while, he stops and says he's getting hungry. Jimmy gets worried, knowing that Fatty might try to eat him. He throws a handful of green peas to Fatty, who eats them greedily.

Jimmy keeps throwing vegetables to Fatty, until there are none left. The only thing left is a big turnip. Jimmy picks it up and throws it at Fatty, hitting him in the stomach. Fatty falls over and starts rolling down the hill. Jimmy is glad to be rid of him and runs home with the empty wheelbarrow.

Story so far:  Fatty Coon is finding it hard to catch food, and Jimmy Rabbit is worried that he will steal his new wheelbarrow. However, Jimmy has a happy thought and feeds Fatty some green peas. A man throws a turnip at Fatty Coon, who falls over and starts to roll because he is so fat. Frisky Squirrel struggles to push a wheelbarrow home with Jimmy Rabbit on top, and Jimmy tells him that it's because he's not used to it and he's not as strong as Jimmy.

Last chunk: A Narrow Escape (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    [Illustration: 6 A Narrow Escape]    Frisky Squirrel had a hard time pushing the wheelbarrow home with Jimmy  Rabbit on top of the load of vegetables. He puffed and groaned. And he  had to stop every little while to catch his breath.  "You see, you're not used to wheeling a wheelbarrow," Jimmy told him.  "For me, it's no trouble at all. But then, I'm stronger than you are."  Now, Frisky had been almost ready to tell Jimmy that he might trundle  the barrow
