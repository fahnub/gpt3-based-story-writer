Outline: The story follows a group of sheep who get mixed up and start going in different directions. Snowball Lamb ends up face-to-face with Aunt Nancy Ewe, who is so big he can't budge her. Aunt Nancy gets scared when she hears there is a bear around, and she ends up sweeping Snowball off the wall with her. Snowball falls into the raspberry bushes and thinks for sure the bear is going to eat him. However, the bear ends up being scared off by the other sheep and Snowball is left unharmed. Aunt Nancy is not pleased with Snowball when she sees him again and she scolds him for getting them all into a mix-up.

Story so far:  Aunt Nancy turned around on the wall and swept Snowball off it when she heard the word bear. Snowball expected to be eaten by the bear and shut his eyes, holding his breath. A boy who jumped over a stone wall to join a flock of sheep gets scolded by his aunt, who tells him it's all his fault. He argues that it's really her fault, and she turns to her companions for support. There was a mix-up and some sheep were trying to cross a stone wall in one direction while others were trying to go the other way. Snowball got stuck in the middle and couldn't move Aunt Nancy Ewe, who was very large. She asked him where his manners were and he didn't know. Cuffy Bear was running away from something and the only one who could have told what it was, was Cuffy Bear himself.

Last chunk: all  your days?"  And everybody said, "No!"  And then somebody asked, "Where's the bear?"  But nobody could answer that question.  The only one that could have answered it was Cuffy Bear himself. And he  was way up under the mountain--and still running.  There wasn't a sheep in the flock that had been more frightened than  he.
