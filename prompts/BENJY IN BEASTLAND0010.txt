Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A young boy has a series of encounters with different animals, impressing those around him. However, the Muley Cow is unhappy with him for being too nice to Twinkleheels. The passage also describes a man who was beaten for spelling his name wrong. Ben is excited to go get him. Miss Celia gives the Italian her address and asks him to let her know if he finds Sanch. Nox, on the other hand, likes cold water, has white teeth and glossy hair, and is always well-groomed. The owl seems displeased when Benny Badger accuses him of being a joker, insisting that he's never made a joke before. Benny is surprised to learn that the owl lives in the hole. The passage describes two dogs, one of which likes to kill animals and the other of which saves lives. The second dog often risks its own life to save others, and it does this near a river where many other animals have drowned. The boy tells the farmer and Bijah that the woman fell in the brook. The farmer and Bijah help the woman and tell the boy to go get the doctor. The passage describes a boy named Ben who is happy to be useful by fetching water from a well. He enjoys the view of the small brown house, the little sisters sitting in the sunshine, and the green hills and newly-planted fields in the distance. The passage describes Benjy's wonder at the Man in the Moon, and his belief that all animals go to the moon after they die. The Man in the Moon speaks to him, inviting him to come up and see if the dog he killed last night is there.

Last chunk: it seemed so large and so close that he thought if he were only on the  highest part of the tree he could touch it with his hand. While he was  looking he thought of a book his mother had, which told him that all  animals went up into the moon after they left the earth.  "I wonder," said Benjy, "if that dog we killed last night is really up  there."  The Man in the Moon looked down on him just then, and, to his surprise,  said:&&  "This is Beastland. Won't you come up and see if the dog is here?
