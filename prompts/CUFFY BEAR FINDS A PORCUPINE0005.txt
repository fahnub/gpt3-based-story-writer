Outline: Cuffy Bear and Silkie are playing in the front yard when Cuffy decides he wants to go to the old tree in the pine woods to play. Silkie reminds him that their mother told them not to go far away, but Cuffy doesn't care and goes anyway. When he gets to the old tree, he finds that it's much smaller than he expected because he's grown taller during the months he spent in sleep. He climbs to the top of the tree and sees a small animal covered in quills moving around in the snow. Cuffy remembers his father telling him never to touch a porcupine because if he does, he'll get his paws stuck full of quills. But he decides to show his father that he's clever enough to kill a porcupine, so he steps close to the porcupine and cuffs it with his paw. The next instant, Cuffy howls in pain and realizes that his paw is full of quills. He starts crying and makes his way home, where his mother has to pull the quills out of his paw. Cuffy never touches a porcupine again.

Story so far:  Cuffy, despite being told not to by his father, steps close to a porcupine and gets his paws stuck full of quills. Cuffy the bear cub tries to play with a porcupine and ends up with quills in his paws. He starts walking home on his hind legs, crying all the way.

Last chunk: and gave it one good,  hard cuff.  The next instant Cuffy gave a howl of pain. He was so angry that he  struck the porcupine once more with his other front-paw.  Again Cuffy howled! Now both his front-paws were full of quills. They  looked just like pincushions. And as Cuffy saw what had happened he  began to cry. He wanted his mother.  So home he started. All the way he had to walk on his hind legs, because  it hurt him terribly whenever he put one of his front-paws on the  ground.  Cuffy wept
