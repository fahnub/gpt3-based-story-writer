Outline: This is a playful poem about a child who is eager to eat their meal. The child is excited about the food they are going to have and the prospect of eating it. The poem speaks to the child's innocence and their joy in the simple things in life.

Story so far:  The passage describes a black and white dog who is particular about keeping his long hair neatly parted in the middle. Benny was a beaver who loved to dig holes. He was so good at it that other animals sometimes used his holes as homes. Benny dug so many holes that some of his neighbors started to object. The young black ram is on the farm and Snowball tells him to leave before the old dog finds him. Mr. Crow lost his taste for corn after Farmer Green came close to shooting him. He was worried that it would never come back to him, and he grew thin and his feathers began to look rusty. His friends were alarmed about his health, but his problem was that he was too careful. The passage describes a chant that is repeated over and over again, with some members of the group adding in a different version of the chant. In the end, the majority of the group wins out and the chant is accepted as truth.

Last chunk: chant was repeated again and again:  _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did!_ But since in any crowd there are  always a few that want to be different from the rest, now and then some  member of Kiddie's clan insisted that Katy didn't--somewhat in this  fashion: _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she didn't!_  However, there were always so many others to drown any such puzzling  statement with their shrill clamor that Katy really _did_ do it  (whatever it was!) that nobody paid much attention to those
