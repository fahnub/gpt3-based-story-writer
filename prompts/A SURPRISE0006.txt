Outline: Cuffy Bear, his sister Silkie, and their father Mr. Bear live in the mountains. One day, when they're finished playing with sand pies, they notice Mr. Bear coming up the mountain with something in his mouth. They run to meet him and ask what it is. He tells them it's a surprise. 

It turns out to be a small white pig. They've never eaten pig before, but they all agree it's delicious. They have a feast and Mr. Bear is very pleased with himself. Cuffy and Silkie both wish that every day could be their birthday.

Story so far:  Mr. Bear brings his wife a pig for her birthday and they have a feast. Cuffy enjoyed his birthday surprise so much that he wishes every day could be his birthday.

Last chunk: any pig before. And when there was  nothing left of the surprise except a few bones, Cuffy couldn't help  wishing that every day could be a birthday.
