Last chunk: BABIES (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Come to the land where the babies grow,    Like flowers in the green, green grass.    Tiny babes that swing and crow    Whenever the warm winds pass,    And laugh at their own bright eyes aglow    In a fairy looking-glass.      Come to the sea where the babies sail    In ships of shining pearl,    Borne to the west by a golden gale    Of sun-beams all awhirl;    And perhaps a baby brother will sail    To you, my little girl.
