Outline: In May, Brer Rabbit is feeling fine and sets off down the road without knowing where he's going. He meets Brer Tarrypin, who asks him where he's headed. Brer Rabbit tells him he's going to have some fun and show everyone a new trick.

Brer Rabbit then heads to Miss Motts and Miss Meadows' houses to tell them about the mill pond fishin' party he's throwing. Everyone agrees to come and they all meet at the pond.

Brer Rabbit jumps in, pretending to be looking for fish, but instead he finds the moon! He calls everyone over to take a look. They all agree that they need to get the moon out of the pond or else it will be goodbye to the light at night.

They all grab onto the seine and start to haul it in, but they have trouble because they're all either too tall or too short. Brer Rabbit just laughs and enjoys the show.

In the end, they all get wet and the moon is safe.

Story so far:  Brer Rabbit and Miss Molly Har' agree to meet at a certain time and place. When the time comes, there is a big crowd of people, and Brer Rabbit is there, waiting for the fun to begin. He shakes his shank and goes to the bank, and makes like he is going to jump in. But what he sees makes him drop his jaw and grin. Brer Rabbit is planning to fish, and he tells all the animals about it. They all say they'll be there to help, and he leaves them wishing they could come. Brer Coon and Brer Fox discuss how to get the moon out of the pond after it falls in. They decide to drag it out with a seine, but when it comes to actually doing the work, they start to argue. A woman is expressing her frustration at having to be "nice" all the time, and her desire to have some fun. She says that if she doesn't have some fun soon, she'll become "sollumcholic" and her head will "get flabby and swink." The passage tells of how Brer Rabbit, Brer Wolf, and Brer Bear all wanted to wade out into the water, but Brer Rabbit was the only one who actually did it. Brer Rabbit is out for a walk and feels good. He doesn't know where he's going, but doesn't care. Brer Tarrypin greets him and asks where he's headed. Brer Rabbit waves his hand and keeps going.
