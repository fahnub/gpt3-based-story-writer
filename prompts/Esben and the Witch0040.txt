Esben is asked to get a dove with feathers of gold and silver timeabout for the king, and he says he will see what he can do. A man named Esben agrees to help a group of trolls who are being persecuted by a king, in exchange for a sack of malt. He uses a magic stick to fly across a stream, and then sets off to find the king. The king has heard that the brothers can procure a boar whose bristles are of gold and silver, and he summons them to ask whether this is true. The brothers deny ever saying or thinking such a thing, and assert that they do not believe that such a boar exists in the world.
