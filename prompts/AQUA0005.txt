Outline: Aqua is a water droplet who lives in the ocean with his mother. He grows tired of playing in the ocean and begs the sun to take him on a journey to see the earth. The sun agrees and transforms Aqua into vapor so that he can ride on the sunbeams.

Aqua has a grand time sailing through the air and looking down at the world below, but when the sun sets he grows scared and tries to return to the ocean. He falls back to earth and lands in a rosebush. The next day he tries again and this time he ends up in a flour mill, where he and his fellow water droplets work the machinery.

Eventually Aqua and his brothers end up in a river which leads them back to the ocean. Aqua is happy to be back home with his mother and tells her all about his adventures.

The passage describes how water droplets become vapor, and how they can rise high into the sky. This passage describes the dangers that Aqua and his brother water-drops face on their journey around the world. Aqua travels to the ocean where he is embraced by the water-drops. Aqua is a drop of water who falls from the sky and becomes frightened as the sun sets. He tries to get back to the earth, and grows heavier as he falls lower, until he is a drop of water again, landing on a rosebush.

Last chunk: fly!  But after a while it grew nearly time for the Sun to go to bed; he  became very red in the face, and began to sink lower and lower, until  suddenly he went clear out of sight!  Poor little Aqua could not help being frightened, for every minute it  grew darker and colder. At last he thought he would try to get back to  the earth again, so he slipped away, and as he fell lower and lower  he grew heavier, until he was a little round, bright drop again, and  alighted on a rosebush.
