Outline: Fatty Coon is playing with Jimmy Rabbit and his brother when they get into an argument and Jimmy cuts off Fatty's mustache. Fatty has been looking for them for weeks to get revenge. He finally finds them, but they tell him they have the pink-eye and he should stay away. Fatty doesn't believe them and gets angry, but then he notices their eyes are actually pink. Jimmy tells him they're playing robbers and Fatty should be the robber. Fatty agrees and hides behind a tree. The Rabbit brothers never come back, and Fatty realizes he's been tricked. He becomes a laughing-stock among the forest-people, who constantly call him "Robber!" because of his black mask-like fur.

Story so far:  The Rabbit brothers tell Fatty Coon that their pink eyes are probably here to stay. Fatty Coon is alarmed and decides to stay away from them. Jimmy Rabbit and his brother have pink-eye and warn Fatty not to come too near them. Fatty asks if it hurts and Jimmy says it does and doesn't. As long as Fatty doesn't touch them, he'll be safe.

Last chunk: climbing.  Jimmy Rabbit and his brother edged a little further away.  "Better not come too near us!" he said. "We've both got the pink-eye,  and you don't want to catch it."  Fatty paused and looked at the brothers. Sure enough! their eyes were as  pink as anything.  "Does it hurt much?" Fatty asked.  "Well--it does and it doesn't," Jimmy replied. "I just stuck a brier  into one of my eyes a few minutes ago and it hurt awful, then. But  you'll be perfectly safe, so long as you don't touch us."
