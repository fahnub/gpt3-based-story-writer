Last chunk: A MELANCHOLY SONG (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)  Trip upon trenchers,  And dance upon dishes,  My mother sent me for some barm, some barm;  She bid me go lightly,  And come again quickly,  For fear the young men should do me some harm.  Yet didn't you see, yet didn't you see,  What naughty tricks they put upon me?  They broke my pitcher  And spilt the water,  And huffed my mother,  And chid her daughter,  And kissed my sister instead of me.
