Last chunk: BOOTS, BOOTS, BOOTS (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Buster's got a popper gun,    A reg'lar one that shoots,    And Teddy's got an engine    With a whistler that toots.    But I've got something finer yet--    A pair of rubber boots.    Oh, it's boots, boots, boots,    A pair of rubber boots!    I could walk from here to China    In a pair of rubber boots.
