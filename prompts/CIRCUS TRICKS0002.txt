Outline: Johnnie Green has been to the circus and wants to try out some of the tricks he saw there. He first tries to get his dog Spot to jump through a hoop of fire, but the dog refuses. Johnnie then goes to the pasture and brings Snowball Lamb back to the farmyard, intending to teach her some tricks so they can join the circus next year.

It takes Johnnie a long time to teach Snowball to jump through a wooden hoop on command, but eventually he succeeds. He then tries to teach her to jump through a paper hoop, but she has difficulty with this. Johnnie decides to make a bigger hoop for the Muley Cow to jump through, but when he is milking her she gets impatient and smacks him with her tail.

Last chunk: trained animals--horses and elephants and dogs and  monkeys and seals. But I didn't see any trained lamb. If you pay  attention and learn what I try to teach you maybe you and I can join the  circus next year."  Snowball Lamb answered, "_Baa-a-a!_"  "All right!" cried Johnnie. "Now you just jump through this wooden  hoop!"  But it didn't prove to be as easy as all that.
