Outline: Johnnie Green sees Mr. Turtle and chases after him. He catches up to Mr. Turtle and traps him with a stick. Johnnie Green is unsure of what to do with Mr. Turtle, but he eventually decides to flip him over on his back. Johnnie Green leaves Mr. Turtle there, unable to move. Mr. Crow arrives and hears Timothy's remarks.

Story so far: The passage describes several animals who are surprised or angry, including a crow who is angry with a hen for not speaking, and a firefly who is surprised by a bumblebee's lack of understanding about nectar. Henrietta Hen will not speak to Mr. Crow because she does not think he is as good as she is. Mr. Crow then proceeds to tell her many things about himself in an attempt to prove her wrong. Johnnie Green soon had a happier one:  why not turn the old scamp over upon his back?  Johnnie had heard that a turtle was helpless when upset in that way. And  he had already made up his mind to flop this one over when he realized  that even with his captive upside down there was still a certain  difficulty.  To be sure, Mr. Turtle couldn't walk away. But he could bite just the  same. And how was a boy going to carve his initials on anybody's back,  when that person was lying on it?  Johnnie
