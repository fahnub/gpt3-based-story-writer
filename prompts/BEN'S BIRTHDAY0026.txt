Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A competition is underway to win a silver arrow. Ben and Bab are two of the best marksmen, but when the old lady catches Ben's jacket and begins questioning him, it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard. The passage describes how Benjy, the only boy in his family, does not play with his two younger sisters. The sisters feel badly about this, and one day they say that they have taken Nox, a big dog, as their brother. The owl tells Benny Badger that he drove a snake away the day before, and looks at him thoughtfully, as if he is planning to attack him. The passage describes a scene in which a group of people are watching a man balance saucers on his chin, nose, and forehead. Mrs. Moss is the only one who speaks, and she exclaims, "That does beat all!" The passage describes a situation where two people shot arrows at a target, and both arrows hit very close to the center. The boys declared the winner to be the one whose arrow was closer to the center, and the girls declared it a tie. Bab could have disputed the decision, but she chose not to.

Last chunk: Bab, at his elbow; and, as if the  breath that framed the generous wish helped it on its way, the arrow  flew straight to the bull's-eye, hitting, apparently, the very spot  where Bab's best shot had left a hole.  "A tie! a tie!" cried the girls, as a general rush took place toward the  target.  "No, Ben's is nearest.  Ben's beat!" Hooray shouted the boys, throwing up  their hats. There was only a hair's-breadth difference, and Bab could  honestly have disputed the decision; but she did not,
