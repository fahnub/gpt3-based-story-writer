Outline: Johnnie Green sees Mr. Turtle and chases after him. He catches up to Mr. Turtle and traps him with a stick.

Mr. Crow arrives and hears Timothy's remarks.

Story so far: Freddie Firefly is going to get nectar from the Bumblebee family. Mr. Crow plans to go out in the rain without an umbrella, against Jasper Jay's advice. Jasper offers to help by holding Mr. Crow's umbrella, but Mr. Crow refuses. Johnnie is considering carving his initials into Mr. Turtle's shell, but he is hesitant because the turtle looks fierce up close and has a strong grip on the stick. Johnnie imagines how unpleasant it would be to have the turtle attached to his body, and decides against it. Old Mr. Crow is in a hurry to leave a crows' meeting because it starts raining, and he doesn't want anybody else to use his umbrella for the first time. Crow was not good at arithmetic and was sitting in a pine looking across a cornfield when he saw a small bird disappear into a giant's head. He exclaimed that the bird must have been eaten, but then the bird reappeared and flew away. Old Mr. Crow knew that if the bird could survive inside the giant's head, then he could too. Mr. Crow is angry at Jasper Jay for stealing his umbrella and taking shelter under it. Jasper Jay is sitting at the top of a tree in the rain, enjoying himself while Mr. Crow, who's umbrella he's using, is not. Johnnie Green turns Timothy Turtle over on his back, upsetting him in the process. He then leaves him there, unable to move. The old gentleman in the passage is complaining about Farmer Green wasting corn on Henrietta Hen. He wishes he was a speckled hen himself so that he could enjoy the same treatment. Mr. Crow grew careless and spent a lot of time in the cornfield, getting fat and short-breathed. Farmer Green vowed to get even with Mr. Crow.

Last chunk: recovered his spirits. And he forgot all about  moving.  But if Mr. Crow felt merry, you may be sure that Farmer Green did not.  It was his turn to feel foolish. And he vowed that he would get even with  Mr. Crow, if it took him all summer.  Meanwhile, Mr. Crow grew careless. He really thought that Farmer Green  wouldn't be able to think of any other way of keeping him out of the  cornfield. And he spent so much of his time there that he grew quite fat.  He became somewhat short-breathed, too.
