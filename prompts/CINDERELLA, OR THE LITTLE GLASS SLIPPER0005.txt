Outline: Cinderella is a kind and good girl who is treated poorly by her step-sisters and made to work as a servant in her own home. When the King of the land throws a ball, Cinderella's step-sisters go and Cinderella is left behind. She is visited by her Fairy godmother who transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, rats into horses and footmen, and Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown. Cinderella goes to the ball and meets the Prince. They dance together and fall in love. Cinderella must leave the ball before midnight or her gown will turn back into rags. She flees and loses one of her glass slippers. The Prince searches for her and finds the slipper. He declares that the woman who can fit the slipper shall be his bride. Cinderella's step-sisters try but fail. Cinderella tries on the slipper and it fits. She tells her story and is married to the Prince. They live happily ever after.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of Cinderella, who is treated poorly by her stepmother and stepsisters. They tell her about the beautiful princess they met at the ball, but Cinderella shows no interest. A prince falls in love with a woman who loses a glass slipper at a ball, and he searches for her throughout the kingdom. He eventually finds her and marries her. Cinderella marries the prince and lives happily ever after. Cinderella's godmother, a good old Fairy, tells her not to cry and that she will also go to the ball. The Fairy turns a pumpkin into a grand coach and a rat into a very smart coachman. The passage describes two sisters who are discussing their outfits for a forthcoming event. The elder sister plans to wear a red velvet suit with French trimmings, while the younger sister intends to wear her usual skirt with a gold-flower mantle and diamond stomacher.
