The kids discuss what it would be like to be a king, with the Story Girl saying that they don't have to wear crowns all the time. Cecily and Felicity are Grass and they are having a good time. Dan is up in his room, sick, and they feel bad for him. Felicity says that he deserves it because he ate bad berries when he was told not to. Cecily then tells a story about Mr. Scott. The Story Girl tells a tale of Mr. Scott's meanness towards his wife. He once made her walk to church in the heat and dust because she wasn't ready on time. The story girl says that being a king doesn't allow for much freedom and Sara decides that she doesn't want to be one. The passage describes a boy who ate a bunch of bad berries and then fell asleep. His uncle and sister argue over who is to blame, with the sister eventually taking the boy's side. The passage describes how a group of friends tried to make up after a fight by sitting quietly and counting to 100. Cecily then went to find Dan andFelicity offered him a jam turnover. Felix gave Felicity an apple he had been saving. Uncle Roger is angry with the children for staying up late, but they explain that they are doing so because their brother Dan ate something that made him sick. Felicity is hurt by something her uncle said to her, and she tells her cousin that she hates him. Her cousin tries to comfort her, telling her that her uncle is just a grown-up and she shouldn't worry about him.

Last chunk: Felicity could  have forgiven Uncle Roger anything but that. It really was unpardonable.  She confided to me as we climbed the stairs that she hated Uncle Roger.  Her red lips quivered and the tears of wounded pride brimmed over in  her beautiful blue eyes. In the dim candle-light she looked unbelievably  pretty and appealing. I put my arm about her and gave her a cousinly  salute.  "Never you mind him, Felicity," I said. "He's only a grown-up."
