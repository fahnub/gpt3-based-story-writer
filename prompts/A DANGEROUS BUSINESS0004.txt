Outline: Sandy Chipmunk tells Daddy Longlegs that he will help him get home, but Daddy Longlegs is hesitant because he knows it is dangerous. Sandy assures him it will be okay and tells him to stand in the middle of the road so that the wagon will have to stop for him. Daddy Longlegs does as he is told and the wagon does indeed stop. Johnnie Green, the boy who is driving the wagon, is surprised to see a Daddy Longlegs in the middle of the road and Sandy Chipmunk tells him that he is going home. Johnnie is hesitant at first, but Sandy convinces him and Johnnie lets Daddy Longlegs ride in the wagon. Sandy runs alongside the wagon as they go and Johnnie is amazed at how fast Daddy Longlegs can walk. They soon reach Daddy Longlegs' home and Sandy says goodbye.

"Hurrah!" Sandy Chipmunk shouted, as soon as Daddy joined him. "Here you  are--and you're just in time! For there's the wagon rattling down the  next hill. And old Ebenezer (that's the horse, please remember!) he'll  climb this rise as fast as he can, because he's in a hurry to get  home."  "He
