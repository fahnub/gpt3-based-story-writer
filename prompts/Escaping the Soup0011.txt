Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

The Scoodler hurls the head of the shaggy man's head at the Rainbow's Daughter, but the shaggy man catches it and puts it in a sack.

The Queen is black-eyed, has a short, curly, silver-crowned head, and a bony, deeply-wrinkled body. She asked the guard what they had brought her, and they said "soup."

Last chunk: black eyes.  She wore a short skirt of  red and yellow and her hair, instead of being banged, was a tangle of  short curls upon which rested a circular crown of silver--much dented  and twisted because the Queen had thrown her head at so many things so  many times.  Her form was lean and bony and both her faces were deeply  wrinkled.  "What have we here?" asked the Queen sharply, as our friends were made  to stand before her.  "Soup!" cried the guard of Scoodlers, speaking together.  "We're
