Outline: A group of animals are racing to Moscow before the close of day. The first to leave is a butterfly riding on a frog. Next is a water rat floating on a log, followed by a caterpillar on the fence and a hopper in the hay. The animals all race as fast as they can, but it's unclear who will make it to Moscow first.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow is proud that he can fly faster than the trains. One day, he waited for a train to pass and boasted that it could not beat him. Brer Rabbit is hosting a race on a hot summer day. A storm blows in, and the child who was playing nearby runs to take shelter with Uncle Remus. The passage describes how Brer Rabbit got covered in mud while being chased by Brer Dust, but was able to clean himself off while the other animals were still covered in mud. This made the other animals mad, and they all went after Brer Rabbit.
