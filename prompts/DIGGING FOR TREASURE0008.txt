Outline: Seven friends are digging for treasure in the garden when they suddenly fall into a hidden tunnel. One of the boys, Albert, is buried under the rubble. The others frantically dig him out and he is unharmed but upset. They all share the two half-crowns they find as treasure.

Story so far: It is better to be doing something than to be talking, and it is more fun to help others than to think only of ourselves. Albert-next-door's uncle has found two half-crowns in the same place. Dora says she was looking at the spot just before and didn't see them. Albert-next-door's uncle tells the boys that their chances of finding buried treasure are slim, as he has studied the subject extensively and knows that most buried treasure only consists of a single coin.

Oswald said that Albert-next-door is very foolish and ignorant, but that it's not his fault and people shouldn't be angry with him for it.

Last chunk: 'What silly nonsense!' He  cannot play properly at all. It is very strange, because he has a very  nice uncle. You see, Albert-next-door doesn't care for reading, and he  has not read nearly so many books as we have, so he is very foolish and  ignorant, but it cannot be helped, and you just have to put up with it  when you want him to do anything. Besides, it is wrong to be angry with  people for not being so clever as you are yourself. It is not always  their faults.  So Oswald said, 'Come and
