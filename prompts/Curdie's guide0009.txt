Outline: Curdie's mother finds the princess sleeping in her chair by the fire and Curdie is surprised to see her. The princess tells him she came because she thought he was in trouble and she wanted to help him. Curdie explains that the cobs have been into her house and into her bedroom, looking for her to take her back to the mountain as a wife for their prince Harelip. The princess is horrified at this and Curdie's mother tells him he must take her home. Curdie explains that he must go and wake his father first. He rushes off to do so and then returns to the cottage to eat breakfast. After breakfast, he tells his mother she must take the princess home herself and he sets off to the mountain to warn his people of the cobs.

Story so far: Curdie follows a thread into the mountains and meets the princess. Curdie tells the princess about his dream, and how he woke up to find the beautiful old lady in his room. The princess is shocked that she didn't know he was hurt and ill, and strokes his hand in sympathy.

Last chunk: Curdie remembered his dream, and was silent, thinking.  'But how did you come to be in my house, and me not know it?' asked the  princess.  Then Curdie had to explain everything--how he had watched for her sake,  how he had been wounded and shut up by the soldiers, how he heard the  noises and could not rise, and how the beautiful old lady had come to  him, and all that followed.  'Poor Curdie! to lie there hurt and ill, and me never to know it!'  exclaimed the princess, stroking his rough hand.
