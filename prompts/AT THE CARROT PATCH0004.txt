Outline: Nimble is a young deer who is determined to try carrots for himself, after his mother tells him how delicious they are. He sets off for the carrot patch one night, but is waylaid by Jimmy Rabbit, who is busy eating cabbages. Jimmy reluctantly shows Nimble to the carrot patch, and then scampers off.

Nimble is disappointed to find that carrots are not as tasty as he was led to believe. He starts to leave the patch, but is pursued by Jimmy Rabbit, who is being chased by a dog. Nimble and Jimmy lose each other in the woods, and Nimble goes home empty-handed.

"But I don't know where the carrots are."  "Why didn't you say so before?" Jimmy Rabbit asked him. And without  waiting for a reply he cried, "Follow me! I'll show you." And he hopped  off briskly, with Nimble after him.  Soon Jimmy Rabbit came to a halt.  "Here it is!" he said. "Here's the carrot patch. Help yourself!" And  then
