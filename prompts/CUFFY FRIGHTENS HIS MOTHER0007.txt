Outline: Cuffy Bear has a run-in with some bees and comes home with his face swollen and in pain. His family doesn't recognize him and his father tells him to leave. Cuffy starts to cry and says it's only him, at which point his family realizes who he is. His mother helps him to bed and he falls asleep. A few days later, he and his father go back to the bee tree to get some honey. They discover that it's not a bee tree at all, but a hornet's nest. Cuffy's father is disappointed, but Cuffy is just glad that he won't have to go near the bees again.

Story so far:  Cuffy's father is not pleased to see the little bear who has come into their house without even knocking. He asks the bear what he wants and what is wrong with his face. Cuffy, who does not understand what his father is saying, just stands there and stares. Cuffy is sad because his family does not recognize him and his father tells him to leave. He cries, "It's me--it's only me!" Cuffy's face was swollen from bee stings, and his nose was a big lump. He had no eyes, just two slits. Mr. and Mrs. Bear were worried and asked if he was sick. Cuffy Bear returns home after an adventure with bees to find his family sitting down to dinner. Cuffy doesn't speak to them, feeling miserable with aching and burning eyes. He tries to make himself small and go unnoticed. Cuffy Bear's father took him back to the bee-tree two days after he was stung, and Cuffy showed him the nest. Mr. Bear was able to take the honey without getting stung too badly. Cuffy was stung by bees, but his father recognized his voice and Cuffy was soon taken care of. A man and his dog discover a hornets' nest, not a bees' nest as they had initially thought. The man is disappointed because they would have gotten no honey from the bees' nest.

Last chunk: paw. And then he began to laugh, though he was somewhat disappointed, as  you will see.  "Those aren't bees!" he told Cuffy. "That's a hornets' nest!... We'd get  no honey there."
