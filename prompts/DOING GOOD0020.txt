Story so far: A woman and her children visit a priest, who tells them about a treasure hidden by their ancestors. The children are excited to find the treasure, but are disappointed when they find it is just a carpet. The woman is speaking in a foreign language and ends with a question. Robert, who is holding the Phoenix, asks it to translate the woman's words. Cyril lays on his back at the foot of the stairs, with his head on the top step and his feet among his young relations, and oils the bolt of his father's bicycle. When the bolt still won't move, he ties it with string. The children in the passage found a small spring and decided to wash their hands and faces in it. Although their pocket-handkerchiefs were too small, they managed to clean themselves up. The passage discusses how the children feel about being selfish and mean. Cyril believes that they are not really being selfish, while Anthea feels that they are. Robert believes that it is worse to know that you are being selfish and not feel bad about it.
