Outline: Father Lime-stick catches a Flower-pecker and is about to kill and eat it when the bird cries out, begging for its life. The bird promises to bring the old man a Bezoar-stone worth at least a thousand if he will let it go. The old man agrees and the bird flies off.

The bird perches on a tree and begins to preen its feathers, getting rid of the bird-lime. Presently the old man calls out, asking where the bird has gone and if it has the Bezoar-stone. The bird replies that it is too absurd to expect it to carry such a heavy stone, and that the old man should remember in future not to undertake an affair that is beyond his capabilities.

Story so far:  The old man in the passage is angry with the bird for not bringing him the Bezoar-stone, and the bird replies that it is too absurd to expect him to carry such a large stone. The old man releases the bird, who promises to bring him a Bezoar-stone as big as a cocoanut and worth at least a thousand dollars. The bird then flies off and begins to preen his feathers. Father Lime-stick catches a Flower-pecker, but the bird begs for its life, saying it is too small to eat. The old man considers letting it go, but decides against it. The bird tells the man that he will not gain anything by repenting for setting it free, and advises him to only undertake tasks that he is capable of.

Last chunk: peace.    "Well,"  continued  the  bird,  "you  will  gain  nothing  by    repenting  that  you  set  me  free.    Only  remember  in  future  not  to    undertake  an  affair  quite  out  of  keeping  with  your  own  powers.    Neither    try  to  get  your  arms  round  a  tree  too  big  for  your  embrace,  nor  attempt    to  climb  one  higher  than  your  strength  permits  you."
