Outline: The animals are planning to get revenge on Brer Rabbit after he tricked them at the barbecue and they all got hurt. They decide to invite him to a dance and then try to make him play the fiddle, hoping to tire him out so they can attack him. But Brer Rabbit is one step ahead of them and tricks them again, leaving them to face the wrath of Miss Meadows.

Story so far:  This passage is from the story "Brer Rabbit's Dilemma" by Uncle Remus. In the story, Brer Rabbit is trying to avoid getting caught by the dogs, so he pretends to be having a party. When Miss Meadows sees him, she tells him to come inside and have some breakfast. The speaker is coming down the road and sees some friends. He asks where they've been and how they're doing. He remarks that he's lucky to have found them, as he's been looking for one of them in particular. The little boy, after hearing how the animals went to the barbecue, wanted to know what happened to them. The old darkey closed his eyes and chuckled, saying that Brother Rabbit had a very quick thinking apple-ratus. The passage describes how a dog that got too close to a bear ended up getting hurt badly. The illustration shows the dog with a big gash running down its side. The speaker says that if the people in the house don't leave, she will call the police.
