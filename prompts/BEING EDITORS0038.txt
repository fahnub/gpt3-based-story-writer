Last chunk: is a law passed about not buying gunpowder  under thirteen.--DICKY.  The price of this paper is one shilling each, and sixpence extra for the  picture of the Malabar going down with all hands. If we sell one hundred  copies we will write another paper.  And so we would have done, but we never did. Albert-next-door's uncle  gave us two shillings, that was all. You can't restore fallen fortunes  with two shillings!
