Outline: A man named Blue Beard has a lot of money and property, but he also has a blue beard which makes him very ugly and scares away all the women and girls. One of his neighbors has two daughters who are very beautiful, and he asks to marry one of them. The daughters are hesitant because of Blue Beard's beard and the fact that he has married and murdered several wives in the past, but they eventually agree to marry him and go to his country estate for a week.

While they are at the estate, Blue Beard tells his wife that he has to go on a business trip for six weeks and gives her the keys to all his properties. He tells her not to go into one particular closet on the ground floor, but she is very curious and eventually gives in to temptation. Inside the closet, she finds the dead bodies of Blue Beard's previous wives.

Blue Beard comes back from his trip early and realizes that his wife has been in the closet. He threatens to kill her, but she is saved at the last minute by her brothers, who kill Blue Beard instead. She inherits all of his property and lives happily ever after.

Story so far: A woman married to Blue Beard is about to be executed by him, but is given a moment to pray first. Up in a tower, her sister Anne keeps watch and reports seeing a dust cloud in the distance. The woman then asks if the visitors are her brothers, but Anne says she does not know.

Last chunk: bestow on him. They would neither of them have him, and they sent him backward and forward from one to the other, neither being able to make up her mind to marry a man who had a blue beard. Another thing which made them averse to him was that he had already married several wives, and nobody knew what had become of them.  Blue Beard, to become better acquainted, took them, with their mother and three or four of their best friends, with some young people of the neighborhood to one of his country
