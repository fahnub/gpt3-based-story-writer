Outline: Once upon a time, the animals got tired of Brer Rabbit's antics and decided to hold a convention to stop him. Brer Fox offered a pot of gold to the creature who could catch Brer Rabbit, and Brer Buzzard said he would try. The other animals agreed, and Brer Rabbit was soon sent for to attend the convention.

Old friend Wobble-nose knew what was going on and warned Brer Rabbit. Brer Rabbit pretended he wanted to learn how to fly, and Brer Buzzard agreed to give him a ride. Brer Rabbit jumped on Brer Buzzard's back and they took off into the sky.

Brer Rabbit had a paw under each of Brer Buzzard's wings and when Brer Buzzard tried to drop him, he would scratch and tickle him. The other animals watched from below, waiting for Brer Rabbit to fall.

After a while, Brer Rabbit got tired of riding and steered Brer Buzzard back down to the ground. He then went into hiding, and when the other animals came looking for him, he was nowhere to be found. And that, as they say, is that.

Story so far: In the story, Brer Rabbit tricks Brer Fox into riding a wild horse, and Brer Fox is injured in the process. The other animals in the forest agree to go on one big hunt for the gold mine, and Brer Rabbit knows he has to be careful around Brer Wolf. A group of animals hold a convention to try and stop Brer Rabbit's pranks. The animals in the story are looking for a gold mine, and they are very excited when they find one. However, they are quickly disappointed when they realize that there is no gold in the mine. The women want the Bear to show them how to do the shuffle, and they put the raccoon down to do a jig. The man is to play the fiddle. A woman is expressing her frustration at having to be "nice" all the time, and her desire to have some fun. She says that if she doesn't have some fun soon, she'll become "sollumcholic" and her head will "get flabby and swink." Brer Rabbit and the other animals are waiting for something to happen. Brer B'ar is growling, Brer Wolf is howling, and Brer Possum is laughing. Then a cloud comes up, and Brer Rabbit knows that Cousin Rain is coming. This passage tells the story of how Brer Rabbit tricked Brer Buzzard into carrying him around, then escaped by steering the buzzard into the ground. The creatures then came up but couldn't find Brer Rabbit.
