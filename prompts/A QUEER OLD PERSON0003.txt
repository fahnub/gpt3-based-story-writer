Outline: Grandfather Mole is a queer old creature who lives in Farmer Green's garden. He is mostly blind and has very small ears, but he is a great digger and has made himself a large home underground. He mostly eats angleworms, which he finds by burrowing through the soil, but he is content to eat any grubs or worms he finds.

Grandfather Mole was blind but had a good sense of smell and a huge appetite. He would go on underground strolls and find angleworms to eat.

The wonder of it was that Grandfather Mole ever found anything to eat,  for the old gentleman was all but blind. The only good Grandfather  Mole's eyes did him was to let him tell darkness from light. They were
