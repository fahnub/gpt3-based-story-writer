Outline: The Despot in the East wishes to be known as a very generous prince, so he gives large presents to anyone of note who comes to his court. However, his officers have secret orders to waylay the recipients of his gifts and recover them. In this manner, many people have been both rewarded and plundered.

Once, a wag comes to court and amuses everyone with his drolleries. The King gives him many presents, including a horse. After taking leave of the King and his courtiers, the Wag bundles up the presents and puts them over his shoulders, and mounting the horse, facing the tail, is about to leave. The King asks him why he is acting in that manner.

The Wag replied, "Sire, simply to see if your officers were coming behind, that I may at once hand over the bundle to them and go about my business."

The Despot is abashed at this, and stops giving any more presents, saying, "Giving is but giving in vain, when we give to take again."

Once a wag came to court and amused everyone. The pig and camel come across a garden. The camel, with its long neck, eats the plants inside while the pig just stands at the bottom of the wall and watches. The camel then asks the pig if it would rather be tall or short. The pig and camel discuss the benefits of being tall or short. The pig laughs at the camel for being too tall to enter the garden, but the camel points out that being tall has its own advantages. They agree that each has its own benefits and there is no clear winner. A camel and a pig argue over which is better off, being tall or being short. They agree to put their respective body parts at stake, and whichever side fails to prove their point will have to give up their advantage.
