Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A competition is underway to win a silver arrow, and two of the best marksmen are Ben and Bab. However, when the old lady catches Ben's jacket and begins questioning him, it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard. A woman is upset with a man, but he does not seem to care. He is more concerned with his dog. Nox used to bring everything he found in the river, including the animals that Benjy had killed and thrown in. Benjy did not like Nox because he was constantly finding and bringing back his victims. This passage describes how Lita and her Arabian horses were complimented by the little girls, who declared it was the loveliest sight they ever beheld. Thorny played "Hail Columbia" on his fife, and Ben crowed long and loud like a happy cockerel who had just reached his majority. The passage describes a boy being hired by an Irishman to take care of the cows. The boy is tempted to play a trick on the Irishman, but decides against it.

Last chunk: never would.  Here a red-headed Irishman came to the door, and stood eying the boy  with small favor while the Squire gave his orders.  "Pat, this lad wants work.  He's to take the cows and go for them.  Give  him any light jobs you have, and let me know if he's good for any  thing."  "Yis, your honor.  Come out o' this, b'y, till I show ye the bastes,"  responded Pat; and, with a hasty good-by to Mrs. Moss, Ben followed his  new leader, sorely tempted to play some naughty trick upon him in
