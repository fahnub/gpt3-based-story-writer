Story so far: Buldeo is tracking Mowgli, and his animal friends are watching and commenting on the situation. Buldeo is tired, but Bagheera says he will be well-rested before he picks up the trail again. The Eaters of Flesh are close behind Mowgli, and eventually force him into the darkness of the night. The animals break into a village and ruin the crops. Whenever there was an alarm, one of the animals would rise up and soothe the others. Mowgli had killed a buffalo with a stick, and the other animals were very impressed. The men are discussing a man named Buldeo who they believe will be able to find and kill the Devil-child. They are worried about the Wolf-demon, which they believe could appear at any time. Buldeo says he will protect the men. The Eaters of Flesh are attacking a village, and the deer, pig, and nilghai are milling around in a circle. The men in the village are sitting on platforms in the crops, waiting to defend themselves. Hathi and his sons are known and talked about by the animals in the jungle for their slow and methodical movements. After a week of feeding, a rumour goes through the jungle that they are on the move again. Buldeo is planning to kill the Jungle Boy and divide up his land and buffaloes among the village. He thinks it's an excellent idea to kill wizards, and people who entertain Wolf-children out of the Jungle.

After that they would  dispose of Messua and her husband, and divide their lands and buffaloes  among the village. Messua's husband had some remarkably fine buffaloes,  too. It was an excellent thing to destroy wizards, Buldeo thought; and  people who entertained Wolf-children out of the Jungle
