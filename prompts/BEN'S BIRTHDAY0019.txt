Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

Last chunk: boy in any thing he cared to try.  It really did look as if Bab would beat when the match for the prize  came off; and the children got more and more excited as the six who were  to try for it took turns at the bull's-eye. Thorny was umpire, and kept  account of each shot, for the arrow which went nearest the middle would  win. Each had three shots; and very soon the lookers-on saw that Ben and  Bab were the best marksmen, and one of them would surely get the silver  arrow.  Sam, who was too
