Outline: Uncle Tom is a slave who lives with his owner, Mr. St. Clare, far away from his home. He is not really unhappy, but he longs to see his family again. His little mistress, Eva, becomes ill and Uncle Tom grows increasingly worried and sad. The doctor is called and Eva improves for a time, but then her health takes a turn for the worse.

One day, Eva tells her father that she is going to die and she asks him to promise to free Tom when she is gone. Miss Ophelia, who has been trying unsuccessfully to reform the naughty Topsy, overhears their conversation and decides to give up on the child. Eva takes Topsy by the hand and leads her into a little room, where she tries to explain to her that if she is good, people will love her. Topsy is skeptical, but she is moved by Eva's words and she promises to try to be good.

Story so far:  The speaker is saying that it is a difficult question whether slavery is wrong or not, and that a lot of people think it is wrong. However, the speaker's child says that when she is dead, the speaker should try to persuade people to do right about slavery for her sake. Uncle Tom was very sad because he missed his family, and also because his little mistress, Eva, was very ill and growing thinner. Miss Ophelia has done a lot to try to reform Topsy, but the girl remains as naughty as ever. Topsy says she thinks it's because she has a wicked heart. Topsy says that even if she were good, she would still be seen as a 'nigger' and nobody would love her. Eva tries to convince her otherwise, but Topsy is skeptical. Miss Ophelia went to her room to take off her bonnet, while Eva talked to her father. Suddenly Mr. St. Clare and his little girl heard a great noise coming from Miss Ophelia's room. A minute later she appeared, dragging Topsy behind her. Miss Ophelia was saying to Topsy, 'Come out here' I will tell your Eva is sad and tells her father that she is going to die soon. She also says that she wishes all slaves were free. Topsy is a young girl who has never had a family or been loved. Eva, a kind woman, tries to understand why Topsy is so naughty and why she doesn't try to be good. Topsy tells Eva that she doesn't know anything about love and that the only thing she loves is candy. Eva is sad for Topsy and tries to find out if she has any relatives.

Last chunk: took Topsy by the hand, and led her into a little room close by.  'What makes you so naughty, Topsy?' she said, with tears in her eyes. 'Why don't you try to be good? Don't you love anybody, Topsy?'  'Dunno nothin' 'bout love. I love candy, that's all.'  'But you love your father and mother?'  'Never had none, ye know. I telled ye that, Miss Eva.'  'Oh, I forgot,' said Eva sadly. 'But hadn't you any brother, or sister or aunt, or--'  'No, none on 'em. Never had nothin' nor nobody.'  'But, Topsy,
