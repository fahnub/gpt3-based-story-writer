Outline: Grumpy Weasel is hiding in a jug to escape Henry Hawk, when he is discovered by Farmer Brown. Old dog Spot smells Grumpy and starts to whine and yelp, but Farmer Brown cannot understand him. Farmer Brown loads the jug onto his wagon and sets off for home, with Grumpy still inside.

It was easy for Grumpy, after that, to crawl out of the jug. He scurried  along the shelf, climbed up the wall, and glided through a crack in the
