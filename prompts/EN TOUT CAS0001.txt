Last chunk: EN TOUT CAS (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)      WHEN I am glad I need your eyes    To be the stars of Paradise;    Your lips to be the seal of all    The joy life grants, and dreams recall;    Your hand, to lie my hands between    What time we walk the garden green.      But most in grief I need your face    To lean to mine in the desert place;    Your lips to mock the evil years,    To sweeten me my cup of tears,    Your eyes to shine, in cloud's despite,    Your hands to hold mine through the night.
