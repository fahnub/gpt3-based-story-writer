Outline: A man named Blue Beard has a lot of money and property, but he also has a blue beard which makes him very ugly and scares away all the women and girls.

The daughters are hesitant because of Blue Beard's beard and the fact that he has married and murdered several wives in the past, but they eventually agree to marry him and go to his country estate for a week.
