Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

Benjy is a naughty, disagreeable boy who is always cloudy, smudgy, and slovenly. The boys are disappointed to learn that the dog they found is not theirs, but Ben suggests that the dog may be his, since he is the same color as Ben's old horse. The girls are determined to beat Ben in archery, and Thorny is encouraging him to do his best. Ben is feeling the pressure, but he's determined to win. The spider tells Benjy that he needs to find a place to tie his first line, and then he has a ball of thread inside of him. Benjy replies that he has a lot of string in his pocket.

Last chunk: each other, too, and so merry and kind to Benjy, that it made him feel  quite at home.  A nice old spider was anxious to teach him how to make a web. So he said  to Benjy:&&  "When you are ready, look around and find a spot where you can tie your  first line; then you have a ball of thread inside of you, of course."  "I can't say that I have," said Benjy, "but I have a good deal of string  in my pocket."  "Oh, well!" said the spider, "that is all right; whether it's in your  pocket or your
