Outline: Frisky Squirrel is being chased by Mr. and Mrs. Hawk, and is getting tired and scared. He calls for his mother, but she is not home. He tries to make a run for his home in a hickory tree, but the hawks won't let him. Suddenly, Mr. Kinglet, a small olive-green bird, comes to his rescue, pecking Mr. Hawk on the back and driving the hawks away. Frisky Squirrel make it safely home, and the forest-people all thank Mr. and Mrs. Kinglet. Frisky Squirrel is ashamed of how he has teased Mrs. Kinglet in the past, and promises to never bother her again.

Story so far:  Mr. and Mrs. Kinglet drove away the animals that were bothering Frisky Squirrel. Frisky Squirrel thanked them and promised not to bother them again. Mr. Kinglet sees Mr. Hawk trying to catch Frisky the wren, so he flies up to Mr. Hawk and pecks him with his sharp bill. There was a small, olive-green bird who lived with his wife not far from Frisky Squirrel's home. Mr. Kinglet was his name. And though he was a tiny fellow he had a heart like a lion's. His wife was brave too. Although they both wore very dull-colored clothes, if you took a good look at Mr. Kinglet you could see that he always wore a bright red crown. A squirrel is being chased by a hawk, but the squirrel's mate comes to help and scares the hawk away.

Last chunk: shake that bold little fellow off his back. And though Mrs. Hawk still  swooped down at Frisky Squirrel, brave Mr. Kinglet's brave little wife  began to fly at _her_ so fiercely that Mrs. Hawk couldn't keep Frisky  from reaching the tree where he lived.  He was very glad to get home, you may be sure. And he dived in through  the door and was out of sight in no time. But pretty soon he stuck his  head out again to see what was happening. Mr. and Mrs. Hawk had  vanished. And all the forest-people
