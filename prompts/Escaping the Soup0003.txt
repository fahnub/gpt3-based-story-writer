Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

Story so far: The shaggy man saves Dorothy, Polly, and Button-Bright from the Scoodlers, who wanted to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are two-faced creatures who live in a cave and chase after their prey. They are defeated when the shaggy man throws their heads back into the gulf. The Scoodlers are headless creatures who stumble around on the rocks. Toto tries to roll one of the heads down the hill, but the other Scoodlers pelted him with their own heads until he was forced to drop it. Dorothy is a little girl who is friends with the Scoodlers.
