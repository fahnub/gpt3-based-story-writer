Outline: Benny Badger is taking a sun nap when he hears three coyotes talking quietly to each other. He learns they are planning to visit a prairie dog village nearby and Benny is intrigued. He decides to follow them and see for himself if there is really a prairie dog village nearby.

He follows their trail and eventually comes across the village. He sees an owl sitting on a heap of earth and approaches him. The owl tells Benny that he is somebody and that there is no need to dig in the hole since he lives there.

One day when he was sunning himself the sound of voices snatched him outof his drowsiness. And he kept quite still, to see what he could see,and hear what he could hear.  Soon three coyotes came sneaking through the grass, talking in
