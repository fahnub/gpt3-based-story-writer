Outline: Sandy Chipmunk tells Daddy Longlegs that he will help him get home, but Daddy Longlegs is hesitant because he knows it is dangerous. Sandy assures him it will be okay and tells him to stand in the middle of the road so that the wagon will have to stop for him. Daddy Longlegs does as he is told and the wagon does indeed stop. Johnnie Green, the boy who is driving the wagon, is surprised to see a Daddy Longlegs in the middle of the road and Sandy Chipmunk tells him that he is going home. Johnnie is hesitant at first, but Sandy convinces him and Johnnie lets Daddy Longlegs ride in the wagon. Sandy runs alongside the wagon as they go and Johnnie is amazed at how fast Daddy Longlegs can walk. They soon reach Daddy Longlegs' home and Sandy says goodbye.

Story so far:  Sandy helps Daddy Longlegs find the road home, then waits for a long time by the roadside. Daddy Longlegs has a hard time walking in the wind. Daddy Longlegs is excited when Sandy Chipmunk tells him that the old horse Ebenezer is coming up the road.

Last chunk: the two watchers saw the old horse Ebenezer come jogging up the  road. And then Sandy Chipmunk said something that sent Daddy Longlegs  into a flutter of excitement.  "Here they come!" cried Sandy. "You'd better stand right in the middle  of the road, so you'll be sure to stop them."  And the mere thought of doing such a dangerous thing as that made Daddy  Longlegs turn quite pale.
