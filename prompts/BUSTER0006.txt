Outline: Buster Bumblebee's mother, the Queen, is worried that her workers won't make enough honey for the family's needs. Buster Bumblebee speaks up and says that he knows of a plan that could help - the honey-makers could work after dark if the Firefly family furnished lights for them.

The Queen liked the idea and sent Buster to talk with Freddie Firefly. Freddie Firefly agreed to help and soon the honey-makers were able to work after dark. Buster Bumblebee was very proud of himself and his successful plan.

Story so far: Buster Bumblebee is afraid of the Robber Fly, but when he meets him he realizes that he is not a bad guy. They become friends and have a great time at Farmer Green's party. Buster Bumblebee was tricked by Peevish Peggy and her companions, who made him think he had been seized by a Robber Fly. In reality, Peevish Peggy had seized him and then let him go when the Robber Fly came near. Buster Bumblebee and Jimmy Rabbit are discussing the latter's upcoming raising bee. Buster is fond of clover and is going to the clover patch to get some. He promises to tell Jimmy all about the raising bee when they meet again in two days. Buster Bumblebee learned his lesson about being rude to others after he laughed in the face of the Robber Fly and was met with silence in return. The Queen tells Buster Bumblebee that she is not jealous of his plan and that he should go talk to Freddie Firefly. If his plan succeeds, he will be able to laugh at others.

Last chunk: least bit jealous of Buster Bumblebee and his plan. When the Queen  frowned at them severely, each of them tried to look as if it had been  somebody else that laughed.  Then the Queen assured Buster that paying a call on a person couldn't be  said to be work.  "You go and talk with Freddie Firefly," she directed him, "and if your  plan proves to be a success, it will then be your turn to laugh at  others."
