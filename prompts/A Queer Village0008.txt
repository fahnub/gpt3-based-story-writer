Outline: Dorothy, the shaggy man, Toto, and Button-Bright are taken prisoner by foxes and led to the royal palace. The fox king questions them and is pleased to learn they are friends. The king tells Dorothy that everyone knows who she is and that she is an important personage since Princess Ozma of Oz made her her friend. The king also reveals that Ozma is going to celebrate her birthday on the twenty-first of the month and expresses his hope to get an invitation.

Dorothy is surprised to learn that they are not in Kansas anymore and that they have been transported to Foxville in Fairyland. The fox king tells her that she can return to Kansas if she wishes, but Dorothy decides to stay and explore Foxville instead.

Story so far: The fox king and his soldiers come to Kansas to find Dorothy and her friends. The fox captain demands their surrender and tells Button-Bright that he is a prisoner. The Fox-King is surprised to learn that the girl he is talking to thinks they are in Kansas. The little girl is content with her life in Kansas, and is not worried about her Aunt Em. The Fox-King approves of this attitude and tells the girl that her new companion (the fox) is very clever and bright. The shaggy man assures Dorothy that he is not to blame for her journey, and that he himself has been feeling strange since he owned the Love Magnet. Button-Bright and the shaggy man come across a big, beautifully decorated arch. It is adorned with peacocks and a fox's head, among other things. The soldiers march the shaggy man, Dorothy, Toto, and Button-Bright back through the arch to the royal palace. There they find a big city with beautiful marble houses.

Last chunk: questions you will learn nothing.  True  enough.  I was wrong.  You're a very clever little boy, come to think  of it--very clever indeed.  But now, friends, please come with me, for  it is my duty to escort you at once to the royal palace."  The soldiers marched back through the arch again, and with them marched  the shaggy man, Dorothy, Toto, and Button-Bright.  Once through the  opening they found a fine, big city spread out before them, all the  houses of carved marble in beautiful colors.
