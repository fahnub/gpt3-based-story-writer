Outline: Frisky Squirrel and Uncle Sammy Coon go to Farmer Green's place to steal corn. Frisky climbs into the corn-house through a hole in the wall and begins dropping corn out for Uncle Sammy to pick up. After a while, Frisky peeks out of the hole to see what's taking Uncle Sammy so long, and is surprised to see that he has run away with the bag of corn. Frisky narrowly escapes getting caught by Farmer Green, and decides not to tell his mother about the incident. The next day, he runs into Uncle Sammy again and confronts him about the stolen corn. Uncle Sammy denies taking it, but Frisky doesn't believe him.

Story so far:  Two animals are planning to steal corn from a farmer's storehouse. They will do so by climbing a tree and crawling through a hole in the wall. Frisky is puzzled when Uncle Sammy says they will divide the bag of corn between them later, and hurries up the tree to get his share. Uncle Sammy explains to Frisky Squirrel that he will be doing most of the work in their corn-picking operation, as he will be the one staying outside to collect the corn dropped through a hole in the wall. A boy is upset that he didn't get any corn, and his uncle laughs. The old man tricked Frisky Squirrel into believing that he had gotten corn for them, when really he had just eaten it all himself. Frisky Squirrel is chased by Farmer Green, who has a gun. Frisky manages to escape by climbing onto the roof of the corn-house and jumping into another tree.

Last chunk: Frisky Squirrel wondered why he had run away. But he didn't wonder  long, for a dog barked; and the bark came from right underneath the  hole in the wall. Then Farmer Green came running up the path which led  to the corn-house. He had a gun in his hand, too.  Frisky didn't wait to see anything more. He whisked out of the hole,  and climbed the roof, and jumped into another tree on the other side  of the corn-house. And soon he too was running like mad along the  road--only he was going in
