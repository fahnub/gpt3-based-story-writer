Outline: Ding dong bell, pussy's in the well! This age-old nursery rhyme tells the story of Tommy Lin, a naughty boy who tries to drown his father's barn cat. Luckily, Johnny Stout is there to save the day and pull the cat out of the well. This classic rhyme is a great way to teach kids about the consequences of their actions.

Story so far:  Sandy Chipmunk was not yet satisfied with his new home and wanted to do something else to it. Sandy Chipmunk is preparing to dig in the ground when he notices someone watching him. He takes off his coat and necktie to avoid getting them dirty, and then sets to work. Sandy never went back to his mother's house until he had washed his face, just as a cat washes hers. Sandy Chipmunk is busy building a deep burrow to live in, so that he won't freeze in winter. Sandy, a gopher, brings up loose dirt and stones to make a home, kicking litter away as he goes. He makes a chamber to sleep in and stores food to last the winter. A boy tries to drown a cat, but is caught and scolded. Sandy Chipmunk had to dig a home below the frost line and bring the dirt out to the top of the ground. He did this by pushing it ahead of him with his nose.

Last chunk: "below frost-line."  You must not think it was an easy matter for Sandy Chipmunk to dig a  home. You must remember that somehow he had to bring the dirt out of his  tunnel to the top of the ground. And he did that by _pushing it ahead of  him with his nose_.  You may laugh when you hear that. But for Sandy Chipmunk it was no  laughing matter. If _he_ had laughed, just as likely as not he would have  found his mouth full of dirt. And you can understand that that wouldn't  have been very pleasant.
