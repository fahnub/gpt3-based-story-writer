Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A young boy has a series of encounters with different animals, impressing those around him with his skills. He then goes on a hunting expedition with a group of girls, impressing their hostess. However, the Muley Cow is unhappy with him for being too nice to Twinkleheels. The passage also describes a man who was beaten for spelling his name wrong. Ben is excited to go get him. Miss Celia gives the Italian her address and asks him to let her know if he finds Sanch. Bab and Betty are preparing for a party when they see their friends peeking over the wall at them. Ben is very impressed with Bab's skill and gives her the prize he won. The passage describes a boy and a dog eating hungrily. Benjy and Mr. Rough are falling off the moon and end up in a river. Benjy thinks of all the unkind things he's done and sinks again. The Squire taps on the window and tells the boy he can sleep at Mrs. Moss's house. Mrs. Moss can then see to him and he can come up to his work just as well. Mrs. Moss tells the Squire she will make inquiries about Ben's father and the Squire tells Ben to mind his behavior and have a good report to give when his father comes for him. The speaker is joking with Ben about the types of animals that are found in their area. He says that there are no elephants or camels, but plenty of bears and mules. Ben laughs, and the speaker joins in.

Last chunk: amusement betrayed by the fire in his eyes and the sly smile round  his lips; and being rather tickled by Ben's list of animals, he answered  gravely,--  "Don't raise elephants and camels much round here. Bears used to be  plenty, but folks got tired of them. Mules are numerous, but we have the  two-legged kind; and as a general thing prefer Shanghae fowls to  ostriches."  He got no farther, for Ben laughed out so infectiously that both the  others joined him; and somehow that jolly laugh seemed
