Outline: A group of animals are racing to Moscow before the close of day. The first to leave is a butterfly riding on a frog. Next is a water rat floating on a log, followed by a caterpillar on the fence and a hopper in the hay. The animals all race as fast as they can, but it's unclear who will make it to Moscow first.

Story so far: The passage describes how a crow boasted that it could fly faster than a train, but was later outpaced by Brer Rabbit in a race. The other animals became angry and chased Brer Rabbit, but he was able to clean himself off while they were still covered in mud. Mr. Crow then challenged the Rainmaker to a race, which he won. A man comes down the road, coughing and sneezing. He affects all the animals, who all start coughing and sneezing too. Brer Dust nearly buries Brer Bear. A cloud crops up and Uncle Win and Cousin Rain get out. The race begins and Uncle Win blows his bellows. This is a children's poem about a race to Moscow. Various animals are racing each other to see who can get there first. Brer Rabbit went to the Rainmaker's house and asked him to arrange a race between Brer Dust and Cousin Rain. Mr. Crow races a train and beats it, then flies in front of it, causing it to make a noise and stop.

Last chunk: station and he knew it was about to start.  Pretty soon the train came thundering up the track. And as soon as  it reached him Mr. Crow started to race with it. He had no trouble in  beating it, as he always did. And then he did something he had never done  before. As soon as he had passed the engine he swooped down and flew  right across the track in front of it.  All at once the train set up a terrible noise. It seemed to Mr. Crow that  it ground its teeth. And it came to a sudden stop,
