Outline: Mrs. Robin tells Mr. Meadow Mouse that Grandfather Mole wants to talk to him. Mr. Meadow Mouse goes to Grandfather Mole's house and asks what he wants to talk about.

Grandfather Mole says that Mr. Crow would never believe him. Mr. Meadow Mouse offers to help Grandfather Mole by letting Mr. Crow catch him in one of the hills of corn.
