Outline: Wandering through the woods, Fatty Coon's bright eyes catch a strange gleam from something that is shining and glittering out of the green. Fatty hurries to see what the strange thing is and finds that it is the moon! He is so excited that he runs home to tell his mother, and his brother Blackie, and Fluffy and Cutey, his sisters.

Mrs. Coon is puzzles and walks close to the shining moon to examine it. She realizes that it is a trap that has been set by Farmer Green, or his boy, in hopes that one of her family will see it and fall into the trap. Mrs. Coon hurriedly leads her family away from the spot and back home.

Story so far:  The passage describes Fatty Coon's discovery of the moon. He is surprised to see it so close to the ground, but he knows that it often touches the earth. Fatty claims to have found the moon in the woods and Mrs. Coon is skeptical but amused. Fatty finds a trap, and is glad he didn't start playing with it because then he would have gotten caught. Mrs. Coon hurries her family away and Fatty leads them home. The boy in the passage is excited to see the moon and runs home to tell his family. Mrs. Coon saw a trap and her children knocked her over when she jumped back. Fatty leads his family to the moon, which he has found. Mrs. Coon is not sure that it is really the moon, but the rest of the family is excited.

Last chunk: asked.  "Oh, yes, Mother!" Fatty could hardly wait, he was so eager to lead the  way. And with many a shake of the head, Mrs. Coon, with her family,  started off to see the moon.  "There!" Fatty cried, as they came in sight of the bright, round thing.  "There it is--just as I told you!" And they all set up a great shouting.  All but Mrs. Coon. She wasn't quite sure, even yet, that Fatty had  really found the moon. And she walked close to the shining thing and  peered at it. But not too close!
