Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

He sees the moon shining down at him and feels better.

Last chunk: another little dog and pelting it with stones. This would have been very  good fun, but one of the stones struck the dog and killed him. So the  boys tied something around his neck and threw him into the river.  Benjy went to bed early that night, but he could not sleep, because he  was thinking of that little white dog, and wishing he had not thrown  him into the river; so at last he got up and went to the willow-tree. He  looked up through the branches and saw the moon shining down at him, and
