Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

I wanted the fun of beating, but I don't  care a bit for this girl's thing and I'd rather see it on you."  As he spoke, Ben offered the rosette of green ribbon which held the  silver arrow, and Bab's eyes brightened as they fell upon the pretty  ornament, for to her "the girl's thing" was almost as good as the  victory.  "Oh no; you must wear it to show who won.
