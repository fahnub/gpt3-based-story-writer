Story so far: This passage contains a series of vignettes about animals with different personality traits. It also includes a description of a funeral procession, in which the speaker reflects on their own mortality. Farmer Green played a joke on his flock of sheep by shearing them. Snowball, who didn't belong to the flock, found it amusing. The passage describes how Benny Badger's face scares away ground squirrels, even though it is not particularly frightening. The speaker expects to wait for the wagon, stay at the fair as long as it lasts, and come home when the wagon brings her. She plans to wear her best apron and see the races. The speaker is going to the fair and does not want the strangers there to know about the accident they had.

Last chunk: mention him again! I'm going to the fair, among strangers. And I  shouldn't care to have them know about that accident that happened to  me--not for anything!"
