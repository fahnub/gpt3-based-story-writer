Outline: This lighthearted poem tells the story of what to do (and what not to do) if you should ever find yourself in the Underworld. The poem advises the reader to bring a "sop to Cerberus" (a food offering for the three-headed dog who guards the entrance to Hades), as opposed to simply saying "good dog" and hoping for the best. The illustration shows a comical scene of the dog wagging its tail despite its three angry heads.

Story so far:  The passage describes the last place one would burglarize, with an accompanying illustration.
