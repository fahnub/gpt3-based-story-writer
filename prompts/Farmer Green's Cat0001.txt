Outline: Frisky Squirrel is caught in the attic of Farmer Green's house during a storm. He is frightened and cannot eat the nuts in the attic. When the storm passes, he finds a small opening in the door and escapes to the kitchen. He is pursued by Farmer Green's cat, but he escapes by climbing a tree.

Story so far:  Frisky Squirrel sees an animal spring out from behind the stove and start chasing him. He assumes it is a small dog, but does not stop to take a good look. Frisky Squirrel is captured by Farmer Green's Cat and imprisoned in the attic. Frisky is so frightened that he shivers in a corner and does not eat. All he wants is to be free and outside.

Last chunk: Farmer Green's Cat (Fable:- Ages 5 to 10)    There were plenty of nuts in the attic of Farmer Green's house, where  Frisky Squirrel found himself a prisoner. And you might think that he  wouldn't have felt so unhappy to be there. But Frisky was unhappy. He  was so frightened that he crept into a corner and stayed there,  shivering, for a long time. And he couldn't have eaten a single one of  those nuts if he had tried. He wanted to be free. He wanted to be out  of doors. He wanted to go home.
