Outline: Grunty Pig tumbles through a hole in a fence and is found by old dog Spot, who promises to show him twelve pigs without tails. Grunty is amazed to find that the pigs in the cage have no tails, and he accuses old Spot of trying to trick him. Johnnie Green, the owner of the pigs, comes out and tells them to leave. Grunty and Spot don't see each other for a week, and when they finally meet again, Spot is ashamed of himself for what he did.

Story so far:  Spot the dog leads Grunty Pig to a dozen pigs without tails and tells Grunty that he should ask Farmer Green to be like them. Grunty Pig and old Spot meet and have a conversation in which Grunty Pig asks old Spot why he doesn't have his own tail cut off. Johnnie Green comes out of the woodshed and tells them to get away from his guinea pigs.

Grunty turns on Spot, accusing him of lying about the pigs they're looking at. Spot insists they are pigs, and Grunty eventually concedes that they must be very young ones. Grunty Pig is surprised to see that the twelve little, pudgy, white strangers have no tails.

Old dog Spot snorted.  "You _want_ to see them!" he cried. "Well, nobody's stopping you.  They're right here in front of you!"  Grunty Pig's mouth fell open--he was so astonished. He knew, now, what  made the little, pudgy, white strangers look so queer. There wasn't one  of them that had even a hint of a tail!  Then
