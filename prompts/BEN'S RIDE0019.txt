Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A young boy has a series of encounters with different animals, impressing those around him. He then goes on a hunting expedition with a group of girls, impressing their hostess. However, the Muley Cow is unhappy with him for being too nice to Twinkleheels. The passage also describes a man who was beaten for spelling his name wrong. Ben is excited to go get him. Miss Celia gives the Italian her address and asks him to let her know if he finds Sanch. Benjy hates tubs, brushes, and soap, and prefers to lie in bed late in the morning. Nox, on the other hand, likes cold water, has white teeth and glossy hair, and is always well-groomed. Benjamin Bat asked Freddie Firefly to ask Farmer Green to step outside for a moment because Bat was not feeling well and was afraid he was going to be ill. Ben offers Bab the silver arrow rosette, which she accepts. The passage describes three boys who are investigating a black dog that they believe may be dangerous. They interview the dog's owner and get more information about the dog. Thorny writes to a cousin in New York, asking him to look into the matter and make sure that everything is okay.

Last chunk: any of his wanderings; for such  itinerant showmen often cross each other's paths. Ben and Thorny walked  to the school-corner with him, getting more exact information about the  black dog and his owner, for they had no intention of giving it up so  soon.  That very evening, Thorny wrote to a boy cousin in New York, giving all  the particulars of the case, and begging him to hunt up the man,  investigate the dog, and see that the police made sure that every thing  was right.
