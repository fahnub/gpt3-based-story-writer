Outline: Buster Bumblebee's mother, the Queen, is worried that her workers won't make enough honey for the family's needs. Buster Bumblebee speaks up and says that he knows of a plan that could help - the honey-makers could work after dark if the Firefly family furnished lights for them.

The Queen liked the idea and sent Buster to talk with Freddie Firefly. Freddie Firefly agreed to help and soon the honey-makers were able to work after dark. Buster Bumblebee was very proud of himself and his successful plan.

Story so far: Buster Bumblebee learns his lesson about being rude to others and boasting about things he's afraid of. He agrees to dance without music, since he enjoys dancing and finds the music played by the three fiddlers to be wonderful. However, he is captured by a Robber Fly and is only saved by another insect. Jimmy Rabbit tells Buster Bumblebee about the raising bee happening at Farmer Green's tomorrow, and encourages him to go. Robber Fly tried to attack Peevish Peggy, but she was saved by other workers and is now resting. Buster Bumblebee is a silly boaster and is very young and stupid. Buster Bumblebee meets a trumpeter who tells him to stuff his ears with cotton so he can make more honey before fall. The trumpeter then realizes she has wasted time talking to Buster and goes back to work. Three men are sawing in a room, and the sound is coming from their sawing. Buster turns and sees that old dog Spot is sitting in the doorway, enjoying himself.

And Buster soon learned that the bewitching sound came from the  sawing.  "How do you like the music?" said a voice in Buster's ear. He turned  quickly. And he saw then that old dog Spot had followed the crowd too and  was sitting in the doorway, where everyone had to walk around him. He  seemed to be enjoying himself. And he kept thumping the floor with his  tail as if
