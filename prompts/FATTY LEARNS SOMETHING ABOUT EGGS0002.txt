He thinks they taste great and wishes there were more. Fatty the coon was attacked by a crow, but he made it safely home. His back was torn, but Mrs. Coon was able to help him.

Last chunk: squirrel's nest, or some bird's eggs.  Fatty loved to climb trees. Up in the big hemlock he forgot, for a time,  that he was still hungry. It was delightful to feel the branches swaying  under him, and the bright sunshine was warm upon his back. He climbed  almost to the very tip-top of the tree and wound himself around the  straight stem. The thick, springy branches held him safely, and soon  Fatty was fast asleep. Next to eating, Fatty loved sleeping. And now he  had a good nap.  Fatty Coon
