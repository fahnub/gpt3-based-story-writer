Outline: Ben is an orphan who lives with his dog, Sancho. He is taken in by Miss Celia, who treats him like her own son. She promises to never send him back to the orphanage, and he swears loyalty to her. Miss Celia plays the piano to comfort him after he learns of his father's death, and he falls asleep.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of a boy named Ben Brown whose father died in a remote part of the West. A stranger wrote to the only person whose name was found in Ben's father's pocketbook to let them know of his death. Mr. Smithers offered to take Ben back and care for him, but Ben decided to stay where he was and follow in his father's footsteps. Miss Celia tells Ben that his father has been found and gives him a letter from Mr. Smithers.

Last chunk: faithful Sancho still kept  guard beside his little master, who, with his head pillowed on his arm,  lay fast asleep, dreaming, happily, that Daddy had come home again.
