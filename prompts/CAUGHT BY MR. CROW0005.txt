Outline: Henrietta Hen is scratching for worms in a freshly ploughed and harrowed field when she is caught by Mr. Crow. He accuses her of stealing corn and she doesn't deny it. When he asks her why she doesn't speak, she tells him she is too proud to talk with him and that she doesn't care to be seen speaking to him.

"If you do,  I'll have to tell Farmer Green."  "He feeds me corn every day--cracked corn!" said Henrietta.  "Well, I never!" cried Mr. Crow. "What's he thinking of, wasting good  corn
