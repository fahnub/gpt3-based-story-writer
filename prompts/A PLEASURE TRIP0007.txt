Outline: Timothy Turtle is a wild creature who lives in Pleasant Valley. He occasionally goes on excursions to different parts of the valley, but always returns to Black Creek. The other animals in the valley do not particularly like Timothy, as he is grumpy and never works.

One day, Timothy arrives in the Beaver colony and announces that he will be staying for a week. The Beavers are not pleased, as they are busy creatures who do not like Timothy's lazy ways. However, Grandaddy Beaver reminds them that Timothy has been to the colony before and has never harmed anyone.

 Brownie Beaver, a young member of the colony, thinks that somebody should make Timothy Turtle mend his ways. He believes that Timothy is old enough to know better than to be so lazy.

Story so far:  The beavers are not happy that Timothy Turtle is coming to stay with them, as he is lazy and does not do any work. They all go to Grandaddy Beaver to ask him what to do. Grandaddy Beaver was a wise old soul, and he advised the younger members of the colony to stay calm. He told them about Timothy Turtle, who had visited the pond many years before and had been a perfect gentleman during his stay. The beavers are not happy to see Timothy Turtle, who is known to be grumpy and unpleasant. They hope he will not stay long. Old Grandaddy Beaver says that Timothy Turtle is lazy and has never done a stroke of work in his life. Brownie Beaver hears this and is surprised. Timothy Turtle often visits Black Creek, but sometimes he likes to go on "excursions" to other places in Pleasant Valley. Nobody would suspect that these trips are for pleasure, since Timothy Turtle looks so serious. Brownie Bearer thinks it is a shame that Timothy Turtle does not behave himself.

Last chunk: he thought it was  a shame that _somebody_ couldn't make Timothy Turtle mend his ways. To  Brownie Bearer it seemed that Timothy Turtle was old enough to behave  himself.
