Outline: Farmer Green has a pair of oxen, Bright and Broad, who are very strong but quite slow. Twinkleheels, Farmer Green's pony, is much faster but not nearly as strong. The bays in the barnyard tell Twinkleheels that Bright and Broad are actually quite fast and could easily beat him in a race. Twinkleheels doesn't believe them and challenges the oxen to a race. Bright and Broad agree, but when Twinkleheels asks them if the bays were telling the truth, they simply say that he hasn't asked them a question yet. Twinkleheels is surprised and asks them if they're actually faster than he is. They confirm that they are, and Twinkleheels is shocked. The oxen explain that they're often called upon to do things that require a lot of strength but not much speed, like pulling a heavy load or wagon out of a mud hole. Twinkleheels decides not to race them after all, realizing that he would never be able to win.

Last chunk: told me about you?" he snapped.  "We can't deny it," they chanted.  Twinkleheels was never more surprised.
