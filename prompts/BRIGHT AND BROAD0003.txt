Outline: Farmer Green has a pair of oxen, Bright and Broad, who are very strong but quite slow. Twinkleheels, Farmer Green's pony, is much faster but not nearly as strong. The bays in the barnyard tell Twinkleheels that Bright and Broad are actually quite fast and could easily beat him in a race. Twinkleheels doesn't believe them and challenges the oxen to a race. Bright and Broad agree, but when Twinkleheels asks them if the bays were telling the truth, they simply say that he hasn't asked them a question yet. Twinkleheels is surprised and asks them if they're actually faster than he is. They confirm that they are, and Twinkleheels is shocked. The oxen explain that they're often called upon to do things that require a lot of strength but not much speed, like pulling a heavy load or wagon out of a mud hole. Twinkleheels decides not to race them after all, realizing that he would never be able to win.

Finally, Twinkleheels asked them a question, to which they replied that they hadn't been asked a question. Farmer Green has a pair of oxen, Bright and Broad, who are very different from his pony, Twinkleheels. Bright and Broad are huge and slow-moving, and they never frisk or play like Twinkleheels does. When they do move faster than a walk, they lurch into a strange, shambling swing that makes Twinkleheels giggle. Twinkleheels is a horse who doesn't like Bright and Broad, two other horses, because they are too serious and never seem to have any fun. One day, he tells them that he used to think he was faster than Ebenezer, another horse, but Ebenezer showed him that he was wrong.

Last chunk: forward the wagon just had to  move--or something broke.  Though Twinkleheels admired their strength, he didn't care much for  Bright and Broad's company. They were too sober to suit him. They were  more than likely to stand and chew their cuds and look out upon the  world with vacant stares and say nothing.  "I used to think Ebenezer was a slow old horse," Twinkleheels remarked  to the bays on a winter's day as they stood in the barn. "I thought I  could beat him easily until he showed me that
