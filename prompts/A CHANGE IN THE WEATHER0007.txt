Story so far: This passage describes animals with various personality traits. Grunty Pig is gluttonous, Henrietta Hen is vain, Mrs. Jolly Robin is determined, and Benny Badger is unfriendly. Snowball is curious. One thing that distressed Mrs. Pig was that her children would put their fore feet right into the trough when they ate. No matter what she said to them, they didn't seem to care. Mrs. Pig told them that they were being greedy, but it didn't make a difference. Rusty Wren was a tease who liked to make his wife excited about the thought of people smoking tobacco inside her house. He would always say that he never smoked and never would, but one can see that he enjoyed making his wife upset. A new coat made from the twig of a tree is described.
