Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

Story so far: The children are captured by Scoodlers, who plan to make them into soup. They are saved by the shaggy man, who throws the Scoodlers' heads back into the gulf. They are all relieved to be safe. The passage describes the two-faced, headless creatures known as the Nomes, who terrorized the prisoners with their speed and eerie eyes. The Nomes led the prisoners away from the road and down a hill, using a side path.

Last chunk: either direction, coming or  going, without turning around; because they had two faces and, as  Dorothy said, "two front sides," and their feet were shaped like the  letter T upside down.  They moved with great rapidity and there was  something about their glittering eyes and contrasting colors and  removable heads that inspired the poor prisoners with horror, and made  them long to escape.  But the creatures led their captives away from the rocks and the road,  down the hill by a side path
