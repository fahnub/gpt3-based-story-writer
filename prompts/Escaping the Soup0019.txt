Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

The shaggy man, Dorothy, and Polly are running towards the entrance of a cave, with Button-Bright perched on the shaggy man's shoulders. They are trying to escape something, and are almost to the entrance when they are caught.

Last chunk: moment, so he told Dorothy and Polly to run as fast as  they could for the entrance, and out across the narrow bridge.  "I'll carry Button-Bright," he said, for he knew the little boy's legs  were too short to run fast.  Dorothy picked up Toto and then seized Polly's hand and ran swiftly  toward the entrance to the cave.  The shaggy man perched Button-Bright  on his shoulders and ran after them.
