Outline: Demian's  Fish  Soup  is  the  story  of  a  man  who  loves  fish  soup  so  much  that  he  can't  help  but  try  to  get  his  neighbor, Phocas, to eat as much as he can. Phocas, however, is full after just three platefuls and tries to politely decline any more. Demian is insistent, though, and eventually Phocas gives in and eats a fourth plateful. At this point, he's had enough and makes his escape, vowing never to come back.

Story so far:  The passage describes Demian feeding his neighbor Phocas, who is struggling to eat the soup. In the passage, Demian invites Phocas to have more fish soup, but Phocas declines and runs away.

Last chunk: of  it.  "That's  the  sort  of  friend  I  like!"  cries  Demian.    "I  can't  bear  people    who  require  pressing.    But  now,  dear  friend,  take  just  this  one  little    plateful  more."  But,  on  hearing  this,  our  poor  Phocas,  much  as  he  liked  fish  soup,    catching  hold  of  his  cap  and  sash,  runs  away  home,  not  once  looking    behind  him.  Nor  from  that  day  to  this  has  he  crossed  Demian's  threshold
