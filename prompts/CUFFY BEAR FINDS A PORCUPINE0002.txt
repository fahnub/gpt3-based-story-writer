Outline: Cuffy Bear and Silkie are playing in the front yard when Cuffy decides he wants to go to the old tree in the pine woods to play. Silkie reminds him that their mother told them not to go far away, but Cuffy doesn't care and goes anyway. When he gets to the old tree, he finds that it's much smaller than he expected because he's grown taller during the months he spent in sleep. He climbs to the top of the tree and sees a small animal covered in quills moving around in the snow. Cuffy remembers his father telling him never to touch a porcupine because if he does, he'll get his paws stuck full of quills. But he decides to show his father that he's clever enough to kill a porcupine, so he steps close to the porcupine and cuffs it with his paw. The next instant, Cuffy howls in pain and realizes that his paw is full of quills. He starts crying and makes his way home, where his mother has to pull the quills out of his paw. Cuffy never touches a porcupine again.

Cuffy finds the old tree and climbs to the top, where he sees something moving in the snow. Silkie won't go with him, so he starts off alone to investigate.

Last chunk: Silkie reminded him.  "Oh! I don't care," Cuffy said. "Besides, we'll be back before she  knows it."  But Silkie would not go with him. So naughty Cuffy started off alone for  the pine woods. He found the old tree. It seemed smaller than he  expected. The reason for that was because Cuffy himself had grown tall  during the months that he had spent in sleep.  He climbed the tree to the very top and as he looked down over the snow  he saw something moving a little way off. Whatever it was, it was
