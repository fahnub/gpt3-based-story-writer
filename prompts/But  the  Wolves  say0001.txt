Outline: A group of wolves approach an elephant, asking for permission to take a small contribution of wool from the sheep in order to make coats for winter. The elephant agrees, but warns them to take only what they need and not to harm the sheep. The wolves take a fleece from each sheep, but also take an extra hair from each one. The sheep cry out in protest, but the wolves ignore them and continue taking what they need.

Story so far:  The wolves say that the sheep are stupid for complaining about having to give up a single fleece each, when they (the wolves) have to wear pelisses in winter. The Elephant says he will not permit this.

Last chunk: But  the  Wolves  say: (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)    "Allow  us  to  explain,  O  father.    Did  not  you  give  us  leave  to  take  from    the  Sheep  a  trifling  contribution  for  our  pelisses  in  winter?    It  is    only  because  they  are  stupid  sheep  that  they  cry  out.    They  have  only  a    single  fleece  taken  from  each  of  them,  but  they  grumble  about  giving    even  that!"  "Well,  well,"  says  the  Elephant,  "take  care  what  you  do.    I  will  not    permit
