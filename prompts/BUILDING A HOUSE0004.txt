Outline: Ding dong bell, pussy's in the well! This age-old nursery rhyme tells the story of Tommy Lin, a naughty boy who tries to drown his father's barn cat. Luckily, Johnny Stout is there to save the day and pull the cat out of the well. This classic rhyme is a great way to teach kids about the consequences of their actions.

Story so far:  Sandy Chipmunk was not yet satisfied with his new home and wanted to do something else to it. Sandy Chipmunk is preparing to dig in the ground when he notices someone watching him. He takes off his coat and necktie to avoid getting them dirty, and then sets to work. Sandy never went back to his mother's house until he had washed his face, just as a cat washes hers. Sandy Chipmunk is busy building a deep burrow to live in, so that he won't freeze in winter.

Last chunk: was  a big heap of dirt beneath the beech trees, to show how busy Sandy had  been. There was a big hole in the pasture, too. But it was nothing at  all, compared with the hole Sandy had dug by the time he had finished  his house.  Every morning Sandy Chipmunk came back to the grove of beech trees to  work upon his new house. And it was not many days before his burrow was  so deep that when winter came the ground about his chamber would not  freeze. It was what Farmer Green would have called
