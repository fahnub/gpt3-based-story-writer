Outline: Jasper Jay is a noisy, rowdy bird who loves to tease the cat and eat bugs and fruit. In the winter, he loves to eat nuts. He is especially skilled at cracking open tough nuts. Jasper is also a hoarder, and he likes to hide away nuts in different places so he can have a stash for the winter. However, he often forgets where he hides them and they end up growing into trees. Jasper is a rogue, but he is also helpful to Farmer Green in many ways.

Story so far:  The passage describes a squirrel's habit of storing nuts for the winter. The squirrel hides the nuts in different places, but often forgets where he has hidden them. Jasper the squirrel only likes to eat nuts, and is very skilled at cracking them open. Jasper Jay helps Farmer Green in more ways than one, but would never have guessed that himself.

Last chunk: remember them all. Those that he lost in that fashion  often took root and grew into trees. And so Jasper Jay helped Farmer  Green in more ways than one.  But no doubt Jasper would have shrieked with laughter had anybody  suggested such an idea to him.
