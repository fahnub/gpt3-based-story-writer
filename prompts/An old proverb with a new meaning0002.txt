Outline: The story takes place on a summer morning at a farmhouse in Prince  Edward Island. The farm belongs to Uncle Roger, and the house is full of  children: the narrator and his twin brother Felix, their cousins Dan and  Peter, and the orphaned Story Girl. Also staying with them are  relatives from out of town: Mrs. Patterson and her daughter, and Mrs.  Frewen and her sister, both with young daughters.

The children are in the kitchen, helping with the baking, when they're  joined by Felicity, who overslept herself. The Story Girl has already  baked the bread for the day, but Felicity is dismayed to discover that  she didn't let it rise a second time before putting it in the oven. The  bread is heavy and dense as a result.

The children are sent out to play while Felicity finishes the baking. They  discuss the Story Girl's mistake, and Felix tries to console her by  saying that everyone makes mistakes.

Later, company arrives: first Mrs. Patterson's sister and her family,  then some people from the town of Markdale, and finally Mrs. Frewen and  her sister from Vancouver. After tea, Mrs. Frewen and her sister want to  go to the Carlisle churchyard to visit their father's grave, and Dan  volunteers to stay home with Jimmy Patterson, the two-year-old son of  Mrs. Patterson, who has fallen asleep on the kitchen sofa.

The others go to the graveyard, leaving Dan sitting on the door-step  reading a book. When they return, Jimmy is nowhere to be found. They  search the house and yard, but he's nowhere to be found. They're  getting frantic when they finally discover him asleep under the sofa.

Everyone is relieved, but Dan is the hero of the day. The Story Girl is  a little jealous of Felicity, who received all the compliments during  tea. Cecily asks what "it never rains but it pours" means, and the  Story Girl explains that it means if anything happens, something else is  sure to happen.

Story so far:  The passage describes a search for a missing child, during which the child's mother becomes hysterical. Everybody blames the child's father, who is feeling guilty and upset. The search ends unsuccessfully. The Story Girl is upset because she can't cook, but Felix and Sara try to console her by telling her that she is good at telling stories. The Story Girl explains that the saying "It never rains but it pours" means that if you don't get any marriage proposals, you're likely to get several all at once. Cecily is doubtful at first, but later she tells Felicity what the saying means. The Story Girl turns pale when Felicity accuses her of ruining the bread. Felicity says she would rather have common sense than be a great storyteller. The Story Girl is mortified and begs Felicity not to tell Uncle Roger. The Story Girl is eclipsed by her friend, who is very pretty and takes the lead at the table. Felix says that there is still hope for Anne to learn to cook, despite her previous failed attempts. He says that even though Felicity is probably disgusted with Anne now, he still likes her better than Felicity. Sara Stanley proudly announced that she had baked all the bread for the day, but she was unsure why the loaves seemed smaller than usual. Felicity scolded her for not letting the bread rise a second time before baking it.

Last chunk: bread from the oven.  "Just look," she said proudly. "I have every bit of the bread baked. I  got up at three, and it was lovely and light, so I just gave it a right  good kneading and popped it into the oven. And it's all done and out of  the way. But the loaves don't seem quite as big as they should be," she  added doubtfully.  "Sara Stanley!" Felicity flew across the kitchen. "Do you mean that you  put the bread right into the oven after you kneaded it without leaving  it to rise a second
