Outline: Grandfather Mole is an expert at finding angleworms, much to the envy of Mrs. Jolly Robin. When Mrs. Robin discovers a greedy cowbird in her nest, she enlists Grandfather Mole's help in catching angleworms to feed her growing family.

Grandfather Mole agrees, but only on the condition that he be allowed to eat his fill first. This leaves Mrs. Robin scrambling to find food for her own children, until finally her husband agrees to help catch angleworms full-time.

In the end, Mrs. Robin is glad her husband doesn't have such a voracious appetite as Grandfather Mole.

Story so far:  Mrs. Jolly Robin is upset because her husband is not helping her catch food for their family. She tells him he will have to spend all his time catching angleworms, and he is glad to do it. Mrs. Robin manages to feed her children and the young Cowbird in her nest. Grandfather Mole was an expert at finding angleworms. He had the advantage of being able to prowl his galleries and find the angleworms right where they lived. Grandfather Mole's appetite is terrible. Grandfather Mole eats his lunch at a different time than Mrs. Robin, so he goes into his galleries to find food. He doesn't come back until mid-afternoon. In the passage, Mrs. Robin asks Grandfather Mole for help and is disappointed when he says he can't because he hasn't had his breakfast yet. Grandfather Mole agrees to help Mrs. Robin by catching angleworms for her. Mrs. Robin is looking for food for her family and is happy when Grandfather Mole pops up to help her. Mrs. Robin is a mother who is worried she won't be able to take care of her nestful of children. She begins to suspect that one of her children is a young Cowbird.

Last chunk: to feed a  rapidly-growing family--that she could hunt for angleworms as  Grandfather Mole did. And this summer it seemed to her that she never  would be able to take proper care of her nestful of children.  There was one of her family in particular that was especially greedy.  Mrs. Robin had begun to suspect that he was no child of hers, but a  young Cowbird. Almost as soon as she had finished building her nest she  had discovered a strange-looking egg there. It had been the first to  hatch.
