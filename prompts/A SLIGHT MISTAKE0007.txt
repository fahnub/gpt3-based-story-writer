Outline: Mrs. Woodchuck is telling her Aunt Polly Woodchuck about the Muley Cow's new poke bonnet when they are interrupted by old Mr. Crow. He tells them that the Muley Cow is actually wearing a poke, not a poke bonnet. Aunt Polly and Mrs. Woodchuck are embarrassed and try to leave, but the Muley Cow calls them back and asks how they found out about the poke. Mrs. Woodchuck tells her it was old Mr. Crow who told her, and the Muley Cow says she'd like to have a talk with him.

Story so far:  The ladies gossip about Mr. Frog while Billy helps himself to a carrot. Aunt Polly invites her caller to come with her to see the Muley Cow. Mr. Crow told the Woodchucks where to find the Muley Cow, and they found her wearing a poke bonnet. A woman explains to her friends that she is not wearing a poke bonnet, but a poke (a sort of neck scarf). Mrs. Woodchuck went to Aunt Polly Woodchuck's house to tell her about the Muley Cow. Aunt Polly was eager to see the Muley Cow in her new poke bonnet. Mrs. Woodchuck said she hadn't seen it, but Old Mr. Crow had told her about it that morning. Aunt Polly Woodchuck and Mrs. Woodchuck notice a large wooden collar with a stake attached to it on the Muley Cow's neck. The Muley Cow is acting grumpy and snaps at them. Aunt Polly politely asks the Muley Cow to excuse them. Mrs. Woodchuck and Aunt Polly set out to visit the Muley Cow, but are waylaid by old Mr. Crow. He tells them that the Muley Cow can be found down near the lane. The Muley Cow is angry with Old Mr. Crow for telling Mrs. Woodchuck about the poke, and she wants to talk to him about it.

Last chunk: felt so uncomfortable that they turned away and started off.  "Wait a moment!" the Muley Cow called to them. "How did you hear about  this poke?"  "Old Mr. Crow told me," Mrs. Woodchuck replied.  "I thought so," said the Muley Cow. "And I'd like to have a talk with  him."
