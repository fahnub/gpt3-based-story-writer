Outline: Turkey Proudfoot and his brother Tom are turkeys who are forced to spend their Thanksgiving apart. Three days before the holiday, Tom is put in a pen on his farm. Turkey Proudfoot, who has been living on a neighboring farm, comes to visit him the night before Thanksgiving and finds out that he has been miscounting the days. They talk and eventually fall asleep. The next morning, they wake up and realize that it is Thanksgiving. They spend the day together and are thankful for each other's company.

Story so far:  Turkey Proudfoot is waiting for somebody, but they haven't shown up yet. He's been waiting for three days and nights, and is getting impatient. Finally, he decides to settle down for the night and goes to sleep. Turkey Proudfoot is surprised to see another turkey out in the open, since it is dangerous at that time of year. The other turkey explains that he escaped from the pen because the door was left ajar. Turkey Proudfoot is happy to see his lucky companion. Turkey Proudfoot wakes up feeling cold and huddles against his brother Tom for warmth. Tom remarks that it is a cold night and wishes his legs were like Mr. Grouse's. Turkey exclaims that Tom would look queer if he had legs as short as Mr. Grouse's. The passage describes a man falling asleep while his friend uses him as a windbreak. The next day is Thanksgiving. Turkey Proudfoot was roosting when the newcomer arrived. The newcomer told Turkey Proudfoot that he had been imprisoned for two days and was angry about it. Turkey Proudfoot explained that the newcomer should have left home three days ago and reminded him that they have a yearly meeting. The passage describes a cornfield in November, which is empty and bleak.

Last chunk: BROTHER TOM (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)    It was almost dark in the cornfield on a crisp evening late in November.  It was not Farmer Green's field, but that of a neighbor of his. And it  was far from any house.  The pumpkins had been gathered weeks before. The cornstalks had long  since been cut and now stood in shocks amidst the stubble.  On the whole, the scene was bleak and dismal. Not a creature moved  anywhere. Even the meadow, mice had already found the nights too chilly  for their liking.
