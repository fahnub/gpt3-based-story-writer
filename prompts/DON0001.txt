Outline: Benny Badger is out walking one night when he comes across Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox is a wily gentleman, and Benny Badger is immediately suspicious of him.

Benny Badger asks Mr. Fox what he is up to, and Mr. Fox claims he is just out for a walk. Benny Badger doesn't believe him, and so he decides to follow him.

Sure enough, Mr. Fox soon comes across a bird's nest. He tries to take the eggs, but he is so clumsy that he makes a lot of noise and wakes up the mother bird. The bird starts to attack Mr. Fox, and Benny Badger comes to his rescue.
