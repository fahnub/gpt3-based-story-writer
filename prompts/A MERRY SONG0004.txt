Outline: The Frog family is singing a merry song when Timothy Turtle interrupts them, complaining that they are making too much noise. Ferdinand Frog tells Timothy that they will sing a special song for him, and the whole family starts bellowing their loudest. The song is about a grumpy turtle who is mean and cruel, and Timothy doesn't like it. He tries to drown out the noise by hiding in the mud at the bottom of Black Creek, but he can still hear the song echoing across Pleasant Valley.

Story so far:  Ferdinand Frog and his family sing about a grumpy one with a glittering, wicked eye and cruel jaws. The Frog family and Timothy Turtle are arguing because Timothy is making too much noise. Ferdinand Frog says that they only opened their eyes to make sure Timothy was doing as they asked, and Timothy Turtle replies that he can't trust them. Timothy Turtle is not interested in singing, but his friends sing a special song for him anyway. The passage describes the physical features of a turtle, and states that they would not want to cause pain or offense. Timothy Turtle, upon hearing this, becomes angry, saying that the singers are trying to fool him. Timothy Turtle is not happy when he hears the other animals singing. He tries to drown out the noise by burying himself in the mud at the bottom of the creek, but he can still hear the singing even at daybreak. Ferdinand Frog and the Turtle family have a disagreement about the quality of the Frogs' singing. Ferdinand insists that the Turtles would appreciate the singing more if they were further away, and Timothy Turtle retorts that the singing couldn't sound any worse than it does up close. In the end, Timothy Turtle goes home, and the Frog family grins broadly. This passage describes a noise that is loud and long, but also very unpleasant. Don't ask too many questions about the creature in the passage, or you'll anger it.

And if you poke him with a stick     He'll seize that too--oh, dear!    Now, we'll admit he swims quite well     And that he's slow ashore.    Don't ask us if he wears a shell     Until we tell you more.    Don't ask us if he's fond of fish     Nor seek to learn his age.    And kindly don't express a wish     To see him in a rage!    Don't ask us if his
