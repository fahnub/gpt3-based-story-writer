Outline: Curdie is a miner who lives in a small town at the base of a mountain. One day, he is sent to the mountain to fetch some ore for the blacksmith. On his way there, he meets a strange old woman who tells him that the mountain is full of goblins. Curdie doesn't believe her at first, but when he arrives at the mountain, he sees a goblin himself. He tries to catch it, but it disappears into a hole in the mountain.

Curdie decides to watch the hole to see if the goblin comes out. He does this every night, and eventually sees a whole group of goblins emerge from the hole. They start digging in a different direction, so Curdie follows them. He soon realizes that they are tunneling their way towards the king's house.

Curdie decides to warn the king, but he is captured by the king's men-at-arms before he can reach him. They accuse him of being a thief and lock him up in a room in the house. Curdie is injured in the leg during his capture, and his wound becomes infected. He starts to rave and talk incoherently about the goblins.

The king's nurse, who was present when Curdie first met the princess, overhears him talking and realizes that he is telling the truth. She goes to the king and tells him what Curdie has said. The king orders his men to release Curdie and to listen to what he has to say.

Curdie tells the king about the goblins and their plans to tunnel into the house. The king orders his men to stop them. They dig a trench around the house and fill it with water, which stops the goblins from getting any closer.

The king decides to reward Curdie for his bravery. He gives him a job in the palace and he also allows him to marry the princess. Curdie and the princess live happily ever after.

Story so far: Curdie tells the king's men-at-arms his suspicions of the goblins and is disbelieved. He spends a night in the king's garden observing and is caught. He is accused of killing a goblin, but insists he is innocent.
