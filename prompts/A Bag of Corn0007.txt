Outline: Frisky Squirrel and Uncle Sammy Coon go to Farmer Green's place to steal corn. Frisky climbs into the corn-house through a hole in the wall and begins dropping corn out for Uncle Sammy to pick up. After a while, Frisky peeks out of the hole to see what's taking Uncle Sammy so long, and is surprised to see that he has run away with the bag of corn. Frisky narrowly escapes getting caught by Farmer Green, and decides not to tell his mother about the incident. The next day, he runs into Uncle Sammy again and confronts him about the stolen corn. Uncle Sammy denies taking it, but Frisky doesn't believe him.

Story so far:  Two animals are planning to steal corn from a farmer's storehouse. They will do so by climbing a tree and crawling through a hole in the wall. Frisky is puzzled when Uncle Sammy says they will divide the bag of corn between them later, and hurries up the tree to get his share. Uncle Sammy explains to Frisky Squirrel that he will be doing most of the work in their corn-picking operation, as he will be the one staying outside to collect the corn dropped through a hole in the wall. A boy is upset that he didn't get any corn, and his uncle laughs. The old man tricked Frisky Squirrel into believing that he had gotten corn for them, when really he had just eaten it all himself.

Last chunk: thing. "Oh! you mean that corn that we got last night. Now, I'm sorry  to say that the bag was so heavy I had to drop it, because old dog  Spot was after me, you know. And when I went back to get it, later, it  wasn't there.... We'll have to try again, some other time," he added.  Frisky Squirrel began to see that the old fellow had tricked him.  Uncle Sammy's sides looked very plump, as if he had had an unusually  good meal. And he smiled so pleasantly that Frisky Squirrel became  very angry.
