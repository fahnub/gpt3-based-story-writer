Outline: Freddie Firefly and Dusty Moth are discussing the latter's recent loss of appetite, brought on by his infatuation with the former's picture of the beautiful Betsy Butterfly. To Dusty's dismay, the picture is of an ugly caterpillar, not the beautiful butterfly he was expecting.

Jimmy Rabbit, the artist who made the picture, tries to explain that it is an accurate portrayal of Betsy Butterfly at an earlier stage in her life, but Dusty is not convinced. He flies off in disgust, vowing never to think of Betsy again.

Story so far:  Freddie Firefly falls over in astonishment after seeing the picture for the first time. Jimmy Rabbit explains that Betsy Butterfly was once an ugly caterpillar. He adds that Dusty Moth was also a caterpillar, and was much uglier than Betsy. Jimmy Rabbit tells Freddie that the caterpillar in the orchard is actually a picture of Betsy Butterfly that he painted himself. Dusty Moth is upset because he feels that Betsy Butterfly's portrait does not look like her. Betsy Butterfly was a beautiful caterpillar, even at a young age. Freddie Firefly reminds Dusty Moth that he said he would stop pestering Freddie about Betsy Butterfly if Freddie showed him a picture of her, and Dusty Moth assures Freddie that he won't forget. The passage describes how Dusty Moth, upon seeing Betsy Butterfly for the first time, is unimpressed by her appearance and is surprised that Freddie Firefly was so eager to meet her.
