Outline: Rusty Wren and his wife are looking for a new home. Rusty finds an old hollow apple tree and a hole in a fence-rail, but his wife doesn't want to live so far from the farmhouse. She suggests that they build their nest behind one of the shutters, but Rusty is worried that somebody might come to the window and close the shutter, causing their nest to fall.

Rusty eventually finds a perfect spot for their nest nailed to a tree close to Farmer Green's bedroom window. His wife is delighted and they move in right away.

Story so far:  A wren couple argue over where to build their nest, the wife wanting to be close to the farmhouse while the husband wants to be further away. The passage describes a man's excitement at finding the perfect spot to build a house in Pleasant Valley. Mrs. Rusty is less excited, asking only if the location is in a good neighborhood. The man assures her it is, and she expresses some doubt at the idea of living in a hole in a tree. Rusty and his wife discuss where they should build their nest for the summer. Rusty's wife wants to build it near the farmhouse, while Rusty would prefer a more secluded spot. In the end, they agree that Rusty will find a suitable location for their nest. The passage describes a squirrel's nest that is nailed to a tree. The squirrel's wife is delighted with the nest and says that it is exactly the sort of house she had always hoped to have.

Last chunk: squirrel's nest, I hope?"  "No, no!" he assured her. "It's not really _in_ a tree. It's nailed  to a tree. Come with me and I'll show you."  At that the bustling little pair hastened toward the farmhouse.  And, to Rusty's delight, the moment his wife saw what he had found  she said at once that it was exactly the sort of house she had  always hoped to have, some time.
