Outline: Turkey Proudfoot meets the new peacock on the farm and is immediately intimidated by him. The peacock is much larger than Turkey and has a beautiful, full tail. Turkey tries to talk to the peacock, but he is met with silence. Henrietta Hen tells Turkey that the peacock is likely dumb and Turkey should be polite to him.
