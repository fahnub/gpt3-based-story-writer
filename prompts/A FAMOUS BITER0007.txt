Outline: The story is about a grumpy old turtle named Timothy who likes to bite people. His neighbors don't like him very much because of this, but he doesn't understand why. He thinks it's more fun than anything else. One day, he tries to bite a rock and ends up breaking his teeth. After that, he decides to stop biting people.

Story so far:  Timothy Turtle enjoyed biting people who got too close to him, and didn't understand why others objected to his behavior. Timothy Turtle's offer to be bitten is declined by everyone, as it is safer to leave him alone.

Last chunk: But  perhaps he never stopped to think that one might almost as well bite a  rock as his hard shell. And anybody might better chew a piece of leather  than try to take a mouthful out of his legs, or his neck, or his head.  So no one paid any heed to Timothy Turtle's kind offer. Even Peter Mink,  who was himself overfond of biting people, wisely let Mr. Turtle alone.  There is no doubt that it was the safer way.
