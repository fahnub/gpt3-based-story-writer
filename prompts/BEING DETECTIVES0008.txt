Story so far: Alice and her friends see a light in the window of the house next door and decide to watch it that night. Noel speculates that the burglars chose the house because the people next door are grand and won't know them. However, it turns out that the light was just from the lady next door accidentally knocking over some flowerpots. Alice has noticed something strange and wants to ask Albert's uncle about it. However, the other children think she is just being silly and tell her to tell them what she knows. Alice agrees, but only if they promise not to do anything without her. H.O. tells Alice that she has to be much cleverer to find out strange and hidden crimes. Alice says that it is not very hard because when you read books, you know what the things mean. Dora says that she does not want to have anything to do with murders because it does not seem safe.
