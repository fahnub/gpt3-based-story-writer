Story so far: The passage is about the author's books making people want to do things that the author is about to describe. The author is talking about how other people went to the seaside in September, even though the author could not afford to go. Alice tells her friends that she saw a light in the windows of the house next door, which is shut up. The passage describes how a man and a woman found a newspaper article about a missing woman, and how they tried to figure out if she was the same woman they knew. A figure in a dark cloak, carrying a mysterious burden, passes under a tree where a group of people are hiding. The figure is dressed to look like a woman in a sailor hat. The passage describes a boy's reaction to seeing a sculpture being made. He is initially only able to see the Prodigal Son in a frame on the wall, but then he is able to see the whole process and is amazed. A boy falls from a tree while trying to look into a neighbor's window and writes a note of apology to slip under their door. The passage describes a group of children who are prevented from playing in their garden by a horse-chestnut tree. Dicky climbs to the top of the tree to see if the blinds at the back of the house are down, and they are. The weather is hot and stuffy, so the children make a tent out of a clothes-horse and some blankets. Alice and Oswald are discussing the possibility of becoming detectives, when Alice says she wouldn't want to get anyone into trouble - specifically mentioning murderers and robbers.

Last chunk: another page there  was, 'Mysterious deaths in Holloway.'  Oswald thought there was something in it, and so did Albert's uncle when  we asked him, but the others thought not, so Oswald agreed to drop it.  Besides, Holloway is a long way off. All the time we were talking about  the paper Alice seemed to be thinking about something else, and when we  had done she said--  'I believe we might be detectives ourselves, but I should not like to  get anybody into trouble.'  'Not murderers or robbers?'
