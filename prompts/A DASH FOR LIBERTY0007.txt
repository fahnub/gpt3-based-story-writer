Outline: Trot is dreaming that she is at home in her bed, but she is cold and unable to move. She realizes that she is frozen inside of a block of ice and wakes up. She sees that the mermaid queen, Aquareine, is also frozen and realizes that their enemy, Zog, has frozen them while they slept. Trot decides that the only way to escape is to wait for the queen to melt the ice around them. The queen does so and they are able to swim to Cap'n Bill's room. They find that he is almost frozen and they have to rub him to bring him back to life. The queen and Clia decide that they need to leave the castle and they swim for the opening in the dome. They are followed by scores of sea devils, but they are able to make it through the opening and escape.

Story so far:  The passage tells the story of how Cap'n Bill was brought back to life by the queen and how he soon became comfortable again. He then says that he has decided that if he ever gets out of this situation, he will never go near the North Pole again. Captain Bill and Trot are talking about the Arctic. Captain Bill says that he doesn't like the cold and ice, and that he wouldn't even wear frizzes on his hair. Trot tells him that he doesn't need to worry about that because he doesn't have any hair. The queen and Clia then approach them and tell them that they have decided to allow Captain Bill and Trot to stay in the palace. Princess Clia's wand is frozen, so she cannot help Trot or Cap'n Bill. Trot decides that she will have to find a way to help them herself. The speaker has decided to leave the castle, as Zog's designs have become too dangerous. They will use a magical sword to cut their way through enemies. Both Trot and Cap'n Bill are willing to follow. The princess, who is a fairy, and her companions find Cap'n Bill nearly frozen in his room, which is solid ice. The queen uses her magic power to melt the ice, and Trot and Clia rub Cap'n Bill's hands, nose, and ears to warm him up.

Last chunk: brief time, and the pretty  princess, being herself a fairy, had not been at all affected by the  cold surrounding her.  They now swam to the door of Cap'n Bill's room and found the Peony  Chamber a solid block of ice. The queen worked her magic power as  hard as she could, and the ice flowed and melted quickly before her  fairy wand. Yet when they reached the old sailor, he was almost  frozen stiff, and Trot and Clia had to rub his hands and nose and  ears very briskly to warm him up and bring
