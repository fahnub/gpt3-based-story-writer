Outline: Dickie Deer Mouse stumbles upon Tommy Fox's burrow and, fearing for his life, quickly scampers up a tree to safety. He spends some time searching for a new winter home, and eventually comes across an old, abandoned burrow. He enters the burrow and finds it to be spacious and empty. Dickie decides to make it his home for the winter.

Story so far:  Dickie finds a hole and decides to explore it, finding a big, airy tunnel which goes sharply downwards. He then plunges down the dark hole.

Slipping inside the hole, Dickie found himself in the mouth of a big,  airy tunnel, which went sharply downwards for a few feet.  And without the slightest fear he plunged down the dark hole, to see  what he could see.  [Illustration]      [Illustration]
