Outline: Nimble, a young deer, is excited to have finally grown antlers with three points on each. This summer, his fourth, he is now considered a "three-pointer." He aspires to have five-point antlers like his father, and begins practicing mock battles with his friend Dodger. Dodger is quick and agile, often dodging Nimble's attacks at the last second.

One day, they are practicing their mock battles when Nimble's mother interrupts them, scolding them and warning them that someone could get hurt. They pay little heed to her warning and continue practicing when they are suddenly joined by old Mr. Crow. Mr. Crow encourages them to keep going, and they become more aggressive in their mock battle.

At one point, Dodger and Nimble clash in the air and fall to the ground. Mr. Crow is pleased with this more aggressive mock battle, but Nimble and Dodger have both been hurt in the fall. They are quickly scolded by Nimble's mother and told to never mock battle again.

Story so far:  Nimble and Dodger like to play-fight, but their mother warns them that someone could get hurt if they're not careful. Nimble is a young buck who grows three-point antlers. He aspires to have five-point antlers like his father, and begins practicing for mock battles with his friend Dodger. Dodger and Nimble engage in a mock battle, which Mr. Crow approves of. Dodger the Deer and Nimble are getting ready to fight, but Mr. Crow is not impressed with their efforts. Mr. Crow insults Dodger and Nimble by saying they are as young as Spike Horns, causing Nimble to charge more fiercely than ever. Dodger stands his ground, waiting for the blow. There is a crack and a thud. Mr. Crow squawks in triumph. Nimble and Dodger play games where Nimble tries to charge Dodger and Dodger tries to dodge. Sometimes Dodger stands his ground and Nimble has to check his charge. Old Mr. Crow watches Nimble and Dodger playing and tells them that he would have fun too if he wanted to. He says that ladies are too finicky and don't know what a good time is.

Last chunk: except to stop until  the good lady had gone on and left them. Then, just as they were on the  point of renewing their frolic, somebody spoke in a hoarse voice. It was  old Mr. Crow. He sat on a low branch of a spreading pine, where he had  been watching the contest for some time without being noticed.  "I'd have my fun if I wanted to," he croaked. "Ladies are too finicky.  They don't know what a good time is."  Now, Mr. Crow's remarks pleased Nimble. And they pleased Dodger the  Deer. They
