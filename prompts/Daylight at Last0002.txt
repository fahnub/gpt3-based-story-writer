Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

Story so far: The explorers find themselves at the bottom of a deep well with an Ork. The Ork is cheerful, but the humans are dismayed. They all wonder how they will get out. The Ork offers to carry the humans up the well, but they are afraid of falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork escapes the well and is relieved to be in the sunlight again. The Ork tells the humans that he will take them with him when he leaves the cave, and the humans express concern about falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork tells Trot and Cap'n Bill that it can fly out of the shaft using its mechanical propeller tail, and proceeds to do so. The Ork and Cap'n Bill have been walking through a tunnel for some time and Trot has been sleeping. Cap'n Bill wakes Trot up and they start walking again, hoping to find an exit. The passage describes a hill with a forest behind it. Cap'n Bill and Trot discuss whether the hill is an island, and Trot says that even if it is, it's better than the underground tunnels and caverns they were in before. The Ork agrees, and they all decide to be thankful for their escape. The Ork said they were almost at the end of the tunnel, and they didn't need to wake up yet. Cap'n Bill lit a candle, and they saw that they were at the end of the tunnel.

Last chunk: said.  They resumed the journey and had only taken a few steps when the Ork  cried "Wow!" and made a great fluttering of its wings and whirling of  its tail. The others, who were following a short distance behind,  stopped abruptly.  "What's the matter?" asked Cap'n Bill.  "Give us a light," was the reply. "I think we've come to the end of the  tunnel." Then, while Cap'n Bill lighted a candle, the creature added:  "If that is true, we needn't have wakened so soon, for we were almost  at the end
