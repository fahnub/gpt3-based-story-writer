Outline: Mrs. Robin tells Mr. Meadow Mouse that Grandfather Mole wants to talk to him. Mr. Meadow Mouse goes to Grandfather Mole's house and asks what he wants to talk about. Grandfather Mole tells him that he's been getting into trouble with Mr. Crow because he thinks Grandfather Mole has been eating the seed corn that Farmer Green planted. Mr. Meadow Mouse suggests that Grandfather Mole tell Mr. Crow that he's just been trying to catch the grubs that would eat the corn if he didn't eat them first. Grandfather Mole says that Mr. Crow would never believe him. Mr. Meadow Mouse offers to help Grandfather Mole by letting Mr. Crow catch him in one of the hills of corn. Grandfather Mole agrees, but then tells Mr. Meadow Mouse that he's going to let Mr. Crow catch him with Mr. Meadow Mouse in his mouth. Mr. Meadow Mouse panics and runs away.

Story so far:  Grandfather Mole is in trouble with Mr. Crow because he thinks Grandfather Mole has been eating the seed corn. Mr. Meadow Mouse tries to cheer him up, but Grandfather Mole gets angry and warns him to be careful. Mr. Meadow Mouse is trying to explain to Mr. Crow that he is just doing his job by tunneling into the hills of corn and eating the grubs. Mr. Meadow Mouse is unafraid to use one of Grandfather Mole's doorways to go underground, since he feels just as comfortable there as he does above ground.

Last chunk: Robin  politely, both for the message and for the advice. And then, scampering  to a certain spot that he knew, near the fence, he disappeared through  an opening into the ground. It was one of Grandfather Mole's doorways.  Mr. Meadow Mouse did not hesitate to use it, being one of those  fortunate folk that are quite at home anywhere. It made little  difference to him whether he was above the ground or in it. And aside  from Grandfather Mole and his own family there was no one that knew his  way
