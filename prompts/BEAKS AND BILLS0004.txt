Outline: Turkey Proudfoot is in the woods at night, trying to guess what Simon Screecher the owl is talking about. Simon Screecher eventually tells Turkey Proudfoot that he is talking about his beak, and Turkey Proudfoot gets angry. Simon Screecher tells Turkey Proudfoot that his beak is useless and that he would never be able to fight with it. Turkey Proudfoot gets angry and challenges Simon Screecher to a fight. Simon Screecher tells Turkey Proudfoot that he doesn't fight that way in the woods and that he would never be able to win a fight against him. Turkey Proudfoot is then scared when he hears Solomon Owl, Simon Screecher's cousin, coming. Turkey Proudfoot tells Simon Screecher to meet him tomorrow night instead.

Story so far:  Turkey Proudfoot is angry with Simon Screecher for laughing at him. Screecher says that a fight in the woods is different from a barnyard squabble, and Turkey challenges him to come over and fight. Turkey Proudfoot is talking to another animal about his cousin, Solomon Owl. When they hear Solomon Owl's call, Turkey Proudfoot is startled and says he doesn't want to see him tonight. Turkey Proudfoot is frightened by Simon Screecher, who tells him that they don't fight by pecking in the woods.

Last chunk: you," he cried.  "Huh! We don't fight that way in the woods," Simon Screecher retorted.  "We don't peck. We tear-r-r-r!"  He rolled out the last word in a long-drawn quaver which gave it a  horrid sound--especially in the woods, after dark. And Turkey Proudfoot  felt chills a-running up and down his back.  "A-ahem! You-you needn't bother to come over here," he stammered. "I-I  shouldn't like to peck you. You-er-you seem to be a very pleasant sort  of person."  "Well, I'm not!" Simon Screecher
