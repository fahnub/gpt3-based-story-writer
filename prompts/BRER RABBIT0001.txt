Outline: Once upon a time, the animals got tired of Brer Rabbit's antics and decided to hold a convention to stop him. Brer Fox offered a pot of gold to the creature who could catch Brer Rabbit, and Brer Buzzard said he would try. The other animals agreed, and Brer Rabbit was soon sent for to attend the convention.

Old friend Wobble-nose knew what was going on and warned Brer Rabbit. Brer Rabbit pretended he wanted to learn how to fly, and Brer Buzzard agreed to give him a ride. Brer Rabbit jumped on Brer Buzzard's back and they took off into the sky.

Brer Rabbit had a paw under each of Brer Buzzard's wings and when Brer Buzzard tried to drop him, he would scratch and tickle him. The other animals watched from below, waiting for Brer Rabbit to fall.

After a while, Brer Rabbit got tired of riding and steered Brer Buzzard back down to the ground. He then went into hiding, and when the other animals came looking for him, he was nowhere to be found. And that, as they say, is that.

Story so far: Brer Rabbit tricked Brer Buzzard into carrying him around, then escaped by steering the buzzard into the ground. The creatures then came up but couldn't find Brer Rabbit. Miss Bob White was grateful when Brer Rabbit helped her clean her dress. Brer Rabbit was out for a walk and felt good. Brer Tarrypin greets him and asks where he's headed. Brer Rabbit waves his hand and keeps going. The animals are fed up with Brer Rabbit's antics and decide to teach him a lesson. They invite Brer Owl to help them, and he agrees.
