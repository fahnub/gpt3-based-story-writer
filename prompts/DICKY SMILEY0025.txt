Outline: Dicky Smiley is an eight-year-old boy with a bright personality. His mother tries to call him Richard, after his father, but he resists and everyone ends up calling him Dicky. His father died in battle when he was very young, so his mother has to take care of him and his two sisters by herself. Dicky is a helpful boy and does whatever he can to make his mother's life easier.

One morning, his mother tells him that she wants to give him a present for being such a good helper. They count the money in his piggy bank and find that he has just enough to buy the toolbox he's been eyeing at the store. Dicky is thrilled and immediately runs out to buy it.

On his way to the store, he meets a little girl named Lola who is crying because her dog has been taken to the pound. Dicky sympathizes with her and agrees to help her get her dog back. They walk to the pound together and find that the dog will cost a dollar to release. Dicky only has 95 cents, so Lola offers to earn the rest by singing for him.

Dicky agrees and they go to the local park to sing. Bruno, Lola's dog, is a big hit with the crowd and they earn the final five cents quickly. They go back to the pound to get Bruno and the pound-man surprises them by giving them the dog for free.

Dicky and Lola are overjoyed and walk home together, Bruno running beside them. When they get back to their respective homes, Dicky's mother is surprised to see him with a dog but is even more proud of him when he tells her the story.

Story so far:  The passage describes a boy's excitement at the prospect of buying a toolbox for his birthday. His parents tell him that he can only spend a dollar, and he is thrilled to find that he has 95 cents in his piggy bank, meaning he only needs to earn 5 more cents. The speaker describes how they worked for six months to save up for a toolbox, and now they want their dog Bruno back. The pound-man shows them a hole in the wall of the pound where they can see if the dog is inside. The passage describes the work of the pound-man, who collects stray dogs and locks them up in a pound. Dicky and Lola walk home with Bruno, who chases chickens and kittens along the way. A little boy is surprised to find that a pomouffund-man (a man who gives out free money) has slipped some money into his pocket. He uses the money to buy a tool-box and spends every Saturday afternoon playing with it. Lola, his cat, watches him and enjoys the show. The passage tells the story of how a boy and his dog found two silver half-dollars. The boy had given one of the half-dollars to a pound-man, but the man was so taken with the boy and his dog that he decided not to take the money.

Last chunk: pocket, two shining, chinking,  clinking round things tumbled out on the floor and rolled under  the kitchen table! What could they have been! Why, his two silver  half-dollars, to be sure. And where in the world did they come from, do  you suppose? Why, it was the nicest, funniest thing! The pound-man was  not so cross after all, for he thought Lola and Dicky were two such kind  children, and Bruno such a cunning dog, that he could not bear to take  Dicky's dollar away from him; so while the
