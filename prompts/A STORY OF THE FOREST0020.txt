Story so far: A fir tree is happy that birds are nesting in its branches and tells its mother about Christmas. The children were very happy to see the Christmas tree with all the presents under it.

Last chunk: of each glossy twig was a bright  glittering Christmas candle.  The doors were slowly opened; the children came running in; and when  they saw the shining lights, and the Christmas tree proudly holding  their presents, they made a ring, and danced about him, singing.  And the Fir-tree was very happy!
