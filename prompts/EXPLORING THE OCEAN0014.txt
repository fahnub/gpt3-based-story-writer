Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far: The passage describes a meal with unknown dishes, which the child is suspicious of. Cap'n Bill eats everything without questioning it, so the child decides to do the same. Trot and Cap'n Bill learn that the ice cream they are eating comes from icebergs. The barnacles in the passage are singing a song that, according to the mermaid, usually has no meaning. However, the child asks if they write comic operas, to which the mermaid replies that they seem to enjoy the songs they sing. A sailor encounters an eel, which snaps at his face. The eel is unafraid of the mermaids, who have the power to stiffen them. The passage describes water as being alive and beautiful, with a variety of colors. The child in the passage sees the water as being like jelly, and is fascinated by its ability to move in any direction. The passage describes two fish guarding an avenue in a sea garden. When asked if all is quiet, one of the guards reports that a third fish was sick earlier but is better now and has gone to sleep. The passage describes the lobster slaves of the mermaids, who are clumsy and often drop the food they are carrying. Trot finds them amusing to watch. Merla invites Trot and Cap'n Bill to visit some neighbors with her. They pass over a carpet of sea flowers and enter the dense shrubbery around the palace. In a clearing, they come across a group of floating creatures.

Last chunk: Merla. "But now, if you  will come this way, I will take you to visit some of our neighbors."  They passed over the carpet of sea flowers, the gorgeous blossoms  swaying on their stems as the motion of the people in the water  above them disturbed their repose, and presently the three entered  the dense shrubbery surrounding the palace. They had not proceeded  far when they came to a clearing among the bushes, and here Merla  paused.  Trot and Cap'n Bill paused, too, for floating in the clear
