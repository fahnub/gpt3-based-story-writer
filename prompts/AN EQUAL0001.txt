Outline: A young girl poses a riddle to her father, asking what God never sees, what the king seldom sees, and what we see every day. The answer, of course, is "an equal." The young girl then goes on to ask her father why men are always seeking power, and why women are not given the same opportunities as men. Her father tells her that it is because men are strong and women are weak. The young girl disagrees, asserting that women are just as strong as men. She then asks her father why women are not allowed to be king. He tells her that it is because women are not as smart as men. The young girl once again disagrees, asserting that women are just as smart as men. She then asks her father why men are always making the decisions and women are not given the same opportunities as men. Her father has no answer for this. The young girl then asks her father to give her the same opportunities as her brother, so that she can show him that women are just as equal as men.
