Outline: Fatty Coon is out for a walk when he comes across a turtle's nest. He's never seen turtle eggs before, so he decides to try one. Timothy Turtle, the father, comes home and is not happy to find Fatty Coon eating his eggs. He bites Fatty's paw and threatens to drag him down to the bottom of the creek. Fatty Coon manages to break free and runs away. He meets up with Mr. Crow, who teases him for getting into a fight. Fatty Coon swears he'll never see Timothy Turtle again.

Story so far:  In the passage, Fatty Coon pleads with Timothy Turtle not to pull him into the creek, as his mother would not approve. However, Timothy Turtle ignores Fatty Coon's objections and declares his intention to drag him down to the bottom of the creek. A coon has been caught by a turtle for stealing its eggs.

Timothy Turtle likes turtles' eggs, and he thinks twenty-seven of them are even better. Fatty Coon is surprised by this and tells Timothy he's sorry. Old Mr. Crow and Fatty Coon are discussing Timothy Turtle. Mr. Crow insists that Timothy would have seized Fatty regardless, but Fatty is adamant that he never wants to see Timothy again.

Timothy Turtle manages to hold on, but Fatty Coon finally escapes and the water is churned into a muddy pool. Timothy Turtle claims that Fatty Coon does not fight fair, and that he deliberately tries to injure his opponents.

Anyhow, he found himself free at last; and he lost no time in  scrambling up the bank to safety.  Afterward Timothy Turtle always complained that Fatty Coon didn't "fight  fair."  "He gouges," Timothy would explain. "He'd just as soon stick one of his  claws into your eye as not. And I claim that's something no real  gentleman will do."  Now, Fatty did not leave Black Creek at
