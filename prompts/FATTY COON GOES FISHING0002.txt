Outline: Fatty Coon is strolling by a brook near his home when he sees a bright yellow and red bug land on the water. He reaches out to grab it, and is surprised when he finds himself being pulled into the water by the bug. He realizes there is a line attached to the bug, and at the other end of the line is a man - Farmer Green.

Farmer Green is just as surprised as Fatty Coon, and he starts to laugh when he realizes he almost caught a coon in his trout net. Fatty Coon is not amused, and he swims to the shore and runs into the bushes. He is relieved when the bug flies out of his mouth and takes the line with it. His mouth is sore from the fishhook, but he is otherwise unharmed. He learns his lesson and decides to stick to fishing for fish, not bugs.

Story so far:  Farmer Green was fishing in the brook and Fatty Coon reached out and grabbed the make-believe fly on the end of his line. Fatty Coon is being dragged across a pool by a man on the other side, who is pulling on a line attached to Fatty's mouth. Fatty is frightened. Fatty was fond of bugs, and so when he saw one he put it in his mouth. However, the bug pulled him into the water and he was stung.

Last chunk: Fatty was very fond of bugs--to eat, you know.  So he lost no time. The bright thing had scarcely settled on the water  when Fatty reached out and seized it. He put it into his mouth, when the  strangest thing happened. Fatty felt himself pulled right over into the  water.  He was surprised, for he never knew a bug or a fly to be so strong as  that. Something pricked his cheek and Fatty thought that the bright  thing had stung him. He tried to take it out of his mouth, and he was  surprised
