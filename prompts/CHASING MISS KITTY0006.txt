Outline: Miss Kitty Cat wakes up from a nap and stretches. She then goes to the door and mews to be let out. Once outside, she explore the woodshed and decides it would be a good place to hunt in stormy weather.

She then hops down to the ground and notices how nice Farmer Green's yard is. She sees a movement in the grass and starts to creep towards it, hoping to catch a meadow mouse. However, she is surprised when old dog Spot appears and starts barking at her.

Miss Kitty runs away, with Spot in hot pursuit. She runs towards the barn and manages to lose him inside. However, he quickly corners her and she has to face him down.

Story so far:  Miss Kitty finds the woodshed to be a great place to hunt for mice in bad weather. Kitty usually surprises mice by stalking them, but this time she is the one who is surprised when she doesn't see old dog Spot. Spot the dog spots Miss Kitty Cat and starts barking, causing her to run away. Miss Kitty Cat was chased by Spot, but was able to hide in the barn. When Spot found her, she faced her down and scared her off.

Last chunk: farmyard, she hadn't learned all the fine hiding places. Since Spot  was between her and the house, she made for the barn and sprang through  the open door. Inside Spot quickly cornered her.  With her back arched and her tail almost as big as Tommy Fox's brush,  Miss Kitty Cat turned and faced her pursuer.
