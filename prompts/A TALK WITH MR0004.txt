Grandfather Mole tells him that he's been getting into trouble with Mr. Crow because he thinks Grandfather Mole has been eating the seed corn that Farmer Green planted. Mr. Meadow Mouse suggests that Grandfather Mole tell Mr. Crow that he's just been trying to catch the grubs that would eat the corn if he didn't eat them first. Grandfather Mole says that Mr. Crow would never believe him. Mr. Meadow Mouse offers to help Grandfather Mole by letting Mr. Crow catch him in one of the hills of corn. Grandfather Mole agrees, but then tells Mr. Meadow Mouse that he's going to let Mr. Crow catch him with Mr. Meadow Mouse in his mouth. Mr. Meadow Mouse panics and runs away.
