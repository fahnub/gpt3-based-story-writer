Outline: Johnnie Green's father tells him that owning a cow is a big responsibility, and Johnnie soon learns that this means he has to do things like milk her, even if he'd rather be doing something else. The Muley Cow is always escaping to the back pasture, and Johnnie has to chase her down each time. He eventually turns this into a game, pretending to hunt her like a buffalo, but the Muley Cow is not amused. One day, she gets revenge by holding back her milk when Johnnie tries to milk her.

Johnnie's father taught him that a duty is a duty, and Johnnie applied this lesson to the Muley Cow.

Last chunk: But he soon learned better. His father told him that a duty was  a duty.  And Johnnie knew exactly what he meant.  As for the Muley Cow, she went about her business as if no great change  had come into her life. And if now and then she took a notion to look  for better grass in the back pasture on the edge of the woods, she would  jump the fence just as she always had and stray off among the clumps of  trees and bushes.
