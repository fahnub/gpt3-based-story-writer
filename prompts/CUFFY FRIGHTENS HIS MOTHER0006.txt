Outline: Cuffy Bear has a run-in with some bees and comes home with his face swollen and in pain. His family doesn't recognize him and his father tells him to leave. Cuffy starts to cry and says it's only him, at which point his family realizes who he is. His mother helps him to bed and he falls asleep.

Mr. Bear was able to take the honey without getting stung too badly.

Last chunk: not long before he had  fallen asleep.  But it was two days before Cuffy Bear felt really himself again. And  then his father went off into the forest with him and Cuffy led the way  to the bee-tree; for Mr. Bear knew enough about bees so that he could  take their honey away from them without getting stung badly. He didn't  mind just a _few_ stings, you know.  Well--what do you think happened? When they came to the old tree Mr.  Bear took just one look at the nest into which Cuffy had thrust his
