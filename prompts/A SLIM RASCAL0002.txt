Outline: Solomon Owl sets out to tell Mr. Crow that he is mistaken about Grumpy Weasel being able to fill knot holes at the sawmill. He explains that Grumpy Weasel is too active to do such a thing. Mr. Crow gets angry and tells Solomon Owl that he is the one who is mistaken. He says that Grumpy Weasel is too short-tempered to be welcome anywhere.

Story so far:  Solomon blundered away into the woods after a failed retort to Mr. Crow. Grumpy Weasel is quick, as evidenced by his ability to vanish before your eyes. Mr. Crow believes that Grumpy Weasel would be more useful if he filled knot holes at the sawmill, but Solomon Owl tells him that he is mistaken. Grumpy Weasel has the shortest temper of all the animals in the forest. He is so irritable that even Peter Mink is not as short-tempered as he is. Grumpy Weasel was not welcome because he was mean. Mr. Crow and Mr. Owl are arguing about whether Grumpy Weasel is good at catching prey. Mr. Crow says that Grumpy Weasel is good at catching prey, while Mr. Owl says that Grumpy Weasel is not good at catching prey. Mr. Crow's plan to have Grumpy Weasel work in the sawmill is not wise because Weasel would not be able to keep the knot hole filled.

Last chunk: Mr. Crow's opinion Solomon Owl--the wise old  bird--had given several long hoots and hurried off, though it was broad  daylight, to set Mr. Crow right.  "The trouble--" Solomon explained when he had found Mr. Crow on the edge  of the woods--"the trouble with your plan to have Grumpy Weasel work in  the sawmill is that he wouldn't keep a knot hole filled longer than a  jiffy. It's true that he can fit a very small hole. But if you'd ever  watched him closely you'd know that he's in a hole and out
