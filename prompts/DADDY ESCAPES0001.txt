Outline: The story is about an ant army that is trying to attack a daddy longlegs and the General that is leading them. The problem is that the only stepladder that they could find to use to reach him is too heavy for the whole army to move. Captain Kidd, who is the leader of the army, tells the General that it is Farmer Green's fault for making the stepladder so big. The General gets angry and starts to cry. Meanwhile, the battle is still raging and Daddy Longlegs is unharmed. He starts to walk away and the army is powerless to stop him. General Antenna sees that the daddy longlegs is retreating and she is overjoyed. The army is victorious and they are each rewarded with an extra drink of milk.

Story so far:  The General is upset because they are about to lose the battle and be humiliated. Captain Kidd tries to comfort her, saying it's not her fault and blaming Farmer Green instead. The General and Farmer Green are now enemies, and the battle still rages. However, Daddy Longlegs is unharmed and realizes that the ant army cannot reach him. The passage describes how Captain Kidd and the army are trying to move a stepladder, but it's too heavy. General Antenna is worried that they won't be able to move it. A soldier ant walks through an army of ants, and the soldiers are powerless to stop him. General Antenna is pleased and gives Captain Kidd a hearty slap on the back. The passage tells the story of an army of ants using stepladders to reach and attack Daddy Longlegs. Captain Kidd is ordered by the General to do the same, but is too scared to follow through.

Last chunk: DADDY ESCAPES (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    THAT was a fine idea of General Antenna's--that plan of bringing  stepladders, so that the ant army might climb up on them and reach Daddy  Longlegs, whom they were attacking.  And Captain Kidd told the General on the spot that it was a most happy  thought.  "Then do as I tell you, at once!" the General ordered pompously.  "I can't!" said Captain Kidd, who was terribly frightened, because the  General was sure to be angry.  "_Can't!_" cried General Antenna
