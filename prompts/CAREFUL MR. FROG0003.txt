Outline: Mr. Ferdinand Frog is a tailor who is visited by Timothy Turtle, who wants him to make a new coat. Mr. Frog is initially reluctant, as he is afraid of Timothy Turtle, who has tried to make a meal of him in the past. However, Timothy Turtle assures him that he only wants a new coat and that he will do something handsome for Mr. Frog in return. Mr. Frog agrees, and Timothy Turtle tells him to come outside so that he can whisper to him. Mr. Frog pretends that he is deaf, so Timothy Turtle tells him that he can read what is carved on his shell. Mr. Frog starts to read it aloud, but Timothy Turtle interrupts him, saying that he doesn't want to hear any more. Timothy Turtle then waddles away, looking very fierce.

Story so far:  Frog and Turtle are arguing over whether or not Frog is present. Frog insists he is not there, while Turtle saw him a moment ago. Frog says he is sick in bed and will become ill if Turtle does not leave. Mr. Frog refuses to make a coat for Timothy Turtle because Timothy has been trying to catch Mr. Frog and his friends. Timothy Turtle insists that he was only joking and promises to do something handsome for Mr. Frog if Mr. Frog makes him a coat. Mr. Frog is not interested in making a new coat for Timothy Turtle.

"I haven't come here to hurt you," Timothy Turtle explained, trying to  smile at the face in the window. "I want you to make me a new coat--a  big one that will cover my back all over."  To his great disappointment Mr. Frog shook his head with great force.  "I'm not interested," he announced.  "Do you mean"--Timothy
