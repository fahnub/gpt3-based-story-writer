Outline: The bays in the barn are annoyed with Twinkleheels the pony because they think he is a lazy loafer who is always eating. Twinkleheels tries to explain that his mealy nose doesn't mean he's been eating meal, but the bays don't believe him.

One day, the bays are forced to walk on the tread mill for thrashing, and they are not happy about it. Twinkleheels tries to talk to them, but the thrashing machine is too loud for them to hear him.

Johnnie Green comes to the field and feeds Twinkleheels some of the newly thrashed oats. The bays see this and they are envious.

One of the bays says to his mate, "That pony has begun to eat up the new oats already. I hoped he'd have the decency to decline them when Johnnie Green offered him a taste."

Story so far:  This passage describes how a group of horses are angry with a pony named Twinkleheels for not helping with the thrashing, and Twinkleheels insists that he would like to help but Farmer Green would never allow it. The speaker's mate groans that the pony "even hinted to Johnnie Green that he'd like some oats." The speaker replies that the pony is "mealy-mouthed as well!"

Last chunk: offered him a taste."  "Not he!" groaned his mate. "That pony even hinted to Johnnie Green that  he'd like some oats. I saw him hint, out of the corner of my eye."  "Ah!" cried the other bay. "Twinkleheels not only has a mealy nose. He's  mealy-mouthed as well!"
