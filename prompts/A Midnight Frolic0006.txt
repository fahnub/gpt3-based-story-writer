Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is a pudgy little mouse who lives in a cornfield. He is content to stay at home and eat all the corn he can, but he also enjoys going out at night to frolic with his mouse family. One night, they are warned that Fatty Coon is coming and they all hide. Fatty Coon is a huge, hungry raccoon who has come to the cornfield to eat as many mice as he can. Master Meadow Mouse and his family are able to avoid being eaten by Fatty Coon, but they are now faced with the problem of how to get rid of him.

Story so far:  The mice are having a good time when they suddenly have to hide because Fatty Coon is coming.

Mr. Crow has a plan to get rid of the Meadow Mouse family by having Fatty Coon eat them, but he changes his mind when he realizes that Fatty would probably eat more than all the Meadow Mice combined.
