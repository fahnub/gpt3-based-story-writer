Outline: Mrs. Ladybug is excited to meet a stranger who has recently arrived on the farm. She is eager to learn all about him and tells her neighbors all about him. However, she is soon shocked to discover that the stranger is not from Colorado as she had thought, but is actually from the farm itself.

Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug is discussing Mr. P. Bug with Peppery Polly Bumblebee and is shocked to learn that he is not as well-off as she thought.

Last chunk: satisfaction.  "He's like me!" she decided. "Mr. P. Bug is a hard worker and he doesn't  care for show. He's a plain person. No doubt he put on that yellow coat  to travel in, because it's his best. But he'll wear overalls, perhaps,  if he starts to work in the potato patch--as I suspect he will."  At last, however, Mrs. Ladybug met with a rude shock. She was telling  her news to Peppery Polly Bumblebee, one of the workers in the hive  ruled by Buster Bumblebee's mother, the well-known Queen.
