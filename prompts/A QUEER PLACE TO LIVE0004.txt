Outline: Brownie Beaver lives in a village of beavers that is built in a pond. The houses in the village are all built under water, with doors that lead into a winding hall that goes up into the house. Brownie Beaver's forefathers built the village in this way because they thought it would be safer from enemies. The village has a dam that is used to keep the pond full. The dam is very old and is never finished because the villagers keep making it wider. Brownie Beaver is a young beaver who works on the dam sometimes. The beavers in the village cut down trees and save the bark and branches to eat during winter. Some of the food is stored in the houses and some is fastened under water near the dam. Brownie Beaver thinks his way of living is normal, even though it may seem strange to others.

The villagers kept making it wider, and it had to be kept in repair because bits of it would sometimes wash away. This passage describes a village of beavers who live in houses built in a pond.

If the dam is not maintained, the pond will eventually dry up. This will make it difficult to store food for winter, as the ice will prevent access to the pond. The passage describes how the first settlers in a small town decided to build their houses by a stream, damming it to create a pond. They did this because they thought it would be safer, and they had good ideas about what their houses should be like. The passage describes how the houses of the ancient Mariner people were designed to be difficult to find and enter.

Last chunk: built in that manner. Andthey always insisted that a door leading into a house should be farbeneath the surface of the water, for they believed that that made ahouse safer too.  To you such an idea may seem very strange. But if you were chased byan enemy you might be glad to be able to swim under water, down to thebottom of a pond, and slip inside a door which led to a winding hall,which in its turn led upwards into your house.  Of course, your enemy might be able to swim as well as you. But
