Last chunk: AWAY TO THE RIVER (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Away to the river, away to the wood,    While the grasses are green and the berries are good!    Where the locusts are scraping their fiddles and bows,    And the bees keep a-coming wherever one goes.    Oh, it's off to the river and off to the hills,   To the land of the bloodroot and wild daffodils,    With a buttercup blossom to color my chin,    And a basket of burs to put sandberries in.
