Outline: Ding dong bell, pussy's in the well! This age-old nursery rhyme tells the story of Tommy Lin, a naughty boy who tries to drown his father's barn cat. Luckily, Johnny Stout is there to save the day and pull the cat out of the well. This classic rhyme is a great way to teach kids about the consequences of their actions.

Story so far:  Sandy Chipmunk was not yet satisfied with his new home and wanted to do something else to it. Sandy Chipmunk is preparing to dig in the ground when he notices someone watching him. He takes off his coat and necktie to avoid getting them dirty, and then sets to work. Sandy never went back to his mother's house until he had washed his face, just as a cat washes hers.

Last chunk: As it was, his face was very dirty. But he never went back to his  mother's house until he had washed it carefully, just as a cat washes her  face.  Sometimes Sandy found stones in his way, down there beneath the pasture.  And those he had to push up, too. Sometimes a stone was too big to crowd  through the opening into the world outside. And then Sandy had to make  the opening bigger. After he had done that, and pushed the stone out upon  his dirt-pile, he would make his doorway smaller again
