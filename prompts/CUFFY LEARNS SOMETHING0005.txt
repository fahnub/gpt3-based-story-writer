Outline: Cuffy Bear learns that there is such a thing as maple-sugar and that it tastes a hundred times better than the sweet sap from a sugar-maple tree. He also learns that he must stay away from men, especially Farmer Green.

Story so far:  Cuffy finds a sugar-maple tree and falls asleep. His father comes home and tells them all about maple-sugar. This passage describes how bears can find maple syrup by finding trees with buckets attached to them. Mr. Bear warns Cuffy not to go near the trees because Farmer Green collects the sap every day. Cuffy Bear gets a stomachache after not telling his parents about his adventure to the spring. Cuffy is asleep and sucking on his paw, presumably because he is thinking about the phrase "a hundred times better" from earlier in the night. Cuffy Bear's mother asked him what he had been doing, and he told her about finding and drinking sweet water. She knew he had drunk too much and made him lie down. Cuffy is afraid of Farmer Green, but he forgets his fear when his father tells him that maple-sugar tastes a hundred times better than the sap.

Last chunk: A cold shiver went up and down Cuffy's back at these words. Farmer  Green! Cuffy had heard a great deal about Farmer Green and he certainly  did not want to meet him all alone and far from home. But as soon as the  tickle of that shiver stopped, Cuffy forgot all about his fright.  "This maple-sugar--does it taste as good as the sweet sap?" he asked his  father.  "Yes, my son--a hundred times better!" Mr. Bear replied. "I ate some  once And I shall never forget it."  _A hundred times better!_
