Outline: Bobby Bobolink discovers Timothy Turtle sunning himself in Cedar Swamp and greets him. Bobby begins to sing one of his sprightly songs and Timothy Turtle becomes angry, but he is unable to speak.

Bobby eventually stops singing and wonders why Timothy Turtle didn't ask him to sing more songs. Timothy Turtle has gone into hiding at the bottom of the swamp and Bobby Bobolink can't find him. His friends tell him that Timothy Turtle is just ill-tempered and not actually sick.

Story so far:  Bobby Bobolink finds Timothy Turtle basking in a pool in Cedar Swamp. He asks Timothy if the rumor is true that he has something to say to Bobby.

Bobby sings for Timothy Turtle and Timothy Turtle feels he has heard enough.

It was no wonder that Bobby Bobolink thought as he did, because his  neighbors were always begging him to sing something for them.

And wishing to please Timothy  Turtle, Bobby Bobolink sang as he hadn't sung all summer long.  At last Timothy Turtle felt that he couldn't bear to hear another
