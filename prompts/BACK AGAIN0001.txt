Outline: Mrs. Ladybug's friends miss her after she goes into the farmhouse to stay for the winter. They spread rumors that she is back, and sure enough, she is. However, she is acting strange and will not answer any questions about her winter stay. Her friends try to get her to tell them what happened, but she refuses. Finally, Buster Bumblebee makes a blundering comment and Mrs. Ladybug finally tells them that she and Mrs. Green did not get along well together.

Ladybug's neighbors laugh at her, and she ends up confessing that she didn't get along with Mrs. Green.

They realize they liked her more than they knew, even though she was sometimes sharp-tongued and nosy. They miss her now that she's gone.
