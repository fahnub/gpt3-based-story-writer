Outline: Mr. Frog is a tailor who lives by a creek. One day, he sees Mr. Crow flying overhead and calls out to him. Mr. Crow is on his way to the cornfield and doesn't want to stop, but Mr. Frog insists that he has important news.

Mr. Frog tells Mr. Crow that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler and that's how he makes his famous "Katy did, Katy" song. Mr. Crow is unimpressed and tells Mr. Frog that he won't be spreading this news around.

Mr. Frog is disappointed but Mr. Crow is unmoved. He tells Mr. Frog that he's not going to tell Brownie Beaver about the news either, because they've had a disagreement. Mr. Crow flies off to the cornfield and Mr. Frog is left alone.

Mr. Crow is horrified at this news and vows not to tell Brownie Beaver about it. A frog and a crow have a disagreement, and the crow is no longer the frog's newspaper. The frog asks the crow to mention him when telling the story of what happened, as he was the one who discovered the secret.

Last chunk: Frog.  "Why not?" the tailor demanded.  "We've had a slight disagreement," said Mr. Crow with a hoarse laugh.  "I'm not his newspaper any longer."  "Well, there's nothing to prevent your telling this story to other  people, is there? And you certainly will be willing to mention me at the  same time, won't you?" Mr. Frog inquired with an anxious pucker between  his strange eyes.  "Where do _you_ come in, pray tell?" Mr. Crow inquired coldly.  "Why, I discovered the secret!"  "Perhaps you did--and
