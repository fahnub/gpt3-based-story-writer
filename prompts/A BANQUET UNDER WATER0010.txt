Outline: Trot and Cap'n Bill are guests of the mermaids, and are given a tour of the undersea palace. They are shown to their rooms, which are furnished with beautiful things made of shells and seaweed. They are served a delicious meal by lobster waiters, and then entertaine by the mermaids.

The next day, they are taken by Queen Aquareine to see the most interesting parts of the ocean. Along the way, they pass by many fierce and terrible creatures, but are protected by the Magic Circle that the queen has drawn around them. They visit King Anko, the sea serpent, and then return to the palace.

Story so far:  The queen protects Trot and Cap'n Bill from danger by swimming around them in a circle with her fairy wand. The passage describes a man and a little girl who are guests of the king. The man is amazed by the sights he sees, and the little girl falls asleep. When she wakes up, she is surprised to see a number of fish staring at her. The queen takes Cap'n Bill and the mermaids to the most interesting part of the ocean. The passage describes a mermaid looking at the fish through the glass roof of her palace. She is bothered by the fact that everyone in the sea can see her, and she makes various comments about the fish she sees. Trot and her companions are shown to their rooms by mermaids, who are able to produce light from their bodies. Trot and Cap'n Bill enjoy a delicious meal consisting of many courses, despite some spillage from one of the lobsters.

Last chunk: made them look very funny; but Trot was so hungry after her  afternoon's excursion that she did not pay as much attention to the  lobsters as she did to her supper, which was very delicious and  consisted of many courses. A lobster spilled some soup on Cap'n  Bill's bald head and made him yell for a minute, because it was hot  and he had not expected it, but the queen apologized very sweetly  for the awkwardness of her servants, and the sailor soon forgot all  about the incident in his enjoyment
