Outline: Nimble, a deer, is out foraging for food when he happens upon the cave where he had waited for Cuffy Bear weeks before. He remembers how he had fed upon the green things under the snow and begins to paw away the snow to find more food.

Cuffy Bear, who had been inside the cave sleeping, wakes up and comes out to find Nimble. At first, Cuffy doesn't recognize Nimble because he has shed his horns since they last met.
