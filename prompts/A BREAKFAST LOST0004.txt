Outline: When Farmer Green's cat looked around and discovered that Grandfather Mole had disappeared from the garden, a puzzled look came over her face. She couldn't think where he had gone in just a few seconds.

But she knew then why Mr. Crow had laughed. And she was not pleased.

"Where is he?" she asked Mr. Crow. "You interrupted me at my breakfast and now I've lost it."

Mr. Crow was rocking back and forth on his perch, for a joke--on anybody except himself--always delighted him.

"Grandfather Mole is right here in the garden," he declared.

"Then he must have hidden beneath a vegetable," the cat observed.

"I shouldn't say that, exactly," Mr. Crow replied.

"How far away is he?" the cat demanded.

"That would be hard to tell," Mr. Crow answered.

Farmer Green's cat had never liked Mr. Crow, for no particular reason. And now she certainly had a very special reason for being angry with him.

"It's all your fault," she scolded. "If you hadn't spoken to me I'd never have taken my eyes off Grandfather Mole.... The least you can do," she added, "is to tell me this instant where Grandfather Mole is."

"I've already told you," Mr. Crow reminded her. "He's here in the garden. Find him if you can!"

At that Farmer Green's cat began to run up and down between the rows of vegetables. But she had no luck at all. So after a while she came back and told Mr. Crow that she didn't believe him.

"Tut, tut!" said Mr. Crow. "You haven't looked in the right place."

"I've searched the whole garden!" the cat cried.

"Oh, no!" Mr. Crow exclaimed. "You've looked only on top of the ground. If you want to find Grandfather Mole you must look beneath the surface."

The cat was greatly disappointed when she heard that.

"You don't mean to say that he went into a hole, do you?" she asked.

"I do," Mr. Crow declared.

"I don't see one anywhere," she said.

"If I had I'd have

Story so far:  The cat and Mr. Crow are talking about Grandfather Mole. The cat doesn't like Mr. Crow, and she doesn't believe that Grandfather Mole is in the garden. Mr. Crow says that he is, but he can't tell how far away he is. Grandfather Mole dug himself out of sight in the garden, almost under the cat's nose, much to the amusement of Mr. Crow. When Farmer Green's cat discovered that Grandfather Mole had disappeared, she asked Mr. Crow where he was. Mr. Crow then explained that he had interrupted her at her breakfast and that was why she had lost it. The cat is angry with Mr. Crow for speaking to her and taking her eyes off Grandfather Mole. Mr. Crow tells her that Grandfather Mole is in the garden, and the cat goes off to try and find him. After a while, she comes back and tells Mr. Crow that she couldn't find him. The cat cannot find Grandfather Mole and is told by Mr. Crow that she must look beneath the surface. The cat is disappointed to hear that Grandfather Mole has gone into a hole.

Last chunk: she didn't believe him.  "Tut, tut!" said Mr. Crow. "You haven't looked in the right place."  "I've searched the whole garden!" the cat cried.  "Oh, no!" Mr. Crow exclaimed.
