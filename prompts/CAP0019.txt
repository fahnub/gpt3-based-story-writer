Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of Cap'n Bill, a fish-like man with a wooden leg, and his adventures under water. He meets up with Cap'n Joe, who is also under water, and together they try to move a stepladder. Brownie Beaver is also introduced, who is stuck under a tree trunk. A woman enters a room and comments on how pretty it is, noting that it is owned by the "awful creature" Zog. The sailor says that he once heard of a people who sacrificed humans to their gods, but before doing so, they stuffed them with food and dressed them in pretty clothes. The passage describes how Cap'n Bill saw his reflection in a mirror and thought it was someone else. Trot was also amazed at the sight. Grandaddy Beaver tells the story of a beaver who got stuck in a tree. The beaver gnawed through the tree and was able to walk away. His neighbors had been looking for him, but not near the tree where he had his adventure. The General triumphantly announces that the enemy is retreating and the ants are victorious. There is great rejoicing among the ant colony and the General rewards her soldiers with extra milk at supper. Joe sews buttons on Zog's clothes. He says that Zog is always angry and that he (Joe) is always busy because of it. He tells Cap'n Bill that he (Bill) will probably see him again, but only if he (Bill) can manage to stay alive.

Last chunk: if nothin' more's wanted, I must get back to work."  "What work do you do?" Cap'n Bill asked.  "I sew buttons on Zog's clothes. Every time he gets mad, he busts  his buttons off, an' I have to sew 'em on again. As he's mad most o'  the time, it keeps me busy."  "I'll see you again, won't I, Joe?" said Cap'n Bill.  "No reason why you shouldn't, if you manage to keep alive," said  Cap'n Joe. "But you mustn't forget, Bill, this Zog has his grip on  you, an' I've never known anything to escape him
