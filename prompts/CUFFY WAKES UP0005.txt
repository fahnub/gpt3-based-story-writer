Outline: Mr. and Mrs. Bear and their children, Cuffy and Silkie, live in a cave high up on Blue Mountain. Every winter, they hibernate, sleeping for weeks or months at a time. On the first day of spring, Mr. Bear wakes up and realizes he's very hungry. He goes outside to look for food, and Mrs. Bear wakes up the children, telling them to go outside and play.

Cuffy and Silkie play happily together for a while, but eventually Cuffy loses his temper and hits Silkie. His parents scold him, and he promises to try to be better.

The bears spend the rest of the spring and summer playing, fishing, and gathering food to store up for the next winter. When autumn comes, they say goodbye to the animals who will be hibernating and go back into their cave to sleep.

And he was hungry--oh!  very hungry, because he had not eaten anything for months and months,  since he went to sleep at the beginning of winter.  He went to the door of his house and looked out. And he saw that the  weather was warm and fine. So he stepped back into the bedroom and  said--  _"Ou-e-e-ee!"_ Just like that. And then Mrs. Bear awaked. "Spring has  come," Mr. Bear told her, "and I am going out to fetch something to eat.  Wake
