Outline: The Bumblebee family is out in the meadow when they notice a jug. Buster Bumblebee is curious about the jug and goes to investigate. He hears a roaring noise from inside the jug and tells the other bees that there is an enemy inside. The bees all fly into the jug and are subsequently captured by Johnnie Green. Johnnie takes the jug and shakes it, then sets it down and goes to get more water. The bees inside the jug start to stir and eventually fly out. They are disoriented and don't know what happened. The other bees blame Buster for the incident and are forever remarking on how lazy and stupid he is.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green is pleased after he corked a jug that held angry bumblebees, breaking up their home. Johnnie plans to drown all the stinging insects on his farm, but is unsure about mosquitoes. He pours the contents of the jug onto the ground, killing many bees in the process. Buster Bumblebee and the other workers mistake a jug for the enemy, and they buzz around it menacingly. The workers decided that the whole trouble was Buster's fault and started to treat him worse. The passage describes how a group of half-drowned animals gradually revive in the sun. They never know exactly what happened, but the workers agree that it was probably a miracle.

Last chunk: Buster, too--lay limp and  water-soaked upon the ground, when Johnnie Green hurried away to the  spring to get more water for his father and the hired man, before he went  to the mill-pond.  But it was not long before the half-drowned Buster and his companions  began to stir slightly. Gradually the sun dried their wings and warmed  their chilled bodies. And one by one they picked themselves up and  scurried into their house.  They never knew exactly what had happened. But the workers agreed upon
