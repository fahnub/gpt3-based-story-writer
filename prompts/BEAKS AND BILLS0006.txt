Outline: Turkey Proudfoot is in the woods at night, trying to guess what Simon Screecher the owl is talking about. Simon Screecher eventually tells Turkey Proudfoot that he is talking about his beak, and Turkey Proudfoot gets angry. Simon Screecher tells Turkey Proudfoot that his beak is useless and that he would never be able to fight with it. Turkey Proudfoot gets angry and challenges Simon Screecher to a fight. Simon Screecher tells Turkey Proudfoot that he doesn't fight that way in the woods and that he would never be able to win a fight against him. Turkey Proudfoot is then scared when he hears Solomon Owl, Simon Screecher's cousin, coming. Turkey Proudfoot tells Simon Screecher to meet him tomorrow night instead.

Story so far:  Turkey Proudfoot is angry with Simon Screecher for laughing at him. Screecher says that a fight in the woods is different from a barnyard squabble, and Turkey challenges him to come over and fight. Turkey Proudfoot is talking to another animal about his cousin, Solomon Owl. When they hear Solomon Owl's call, Turkey Proudfoot is startled and says he doesn't want to see him tonight. Turkey Proudfoot is frightened by Simon Screecher, who tells him that they don't fight by pecking in the woods. Turkey Proudfoot is worried about a giant bird, so he asks Simon Screecher to find it and tell it to meet him tomorrow night.

Last chunk: Simon Screecher explained. "And he's  not far away."  "My goodness!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed. "If he's as big as his voice  he must be enormous."  "He's twice my size," said Simon Screecher. "Not nearly as big as you  are, of course! But you ought to see his beak. I do believe he could  tear you into--"  "I don't want to see him to-night," Turkey Proudfoot interrupted. "I  hope he won't come this way. Go and find him. And tell him to meet me  here _to-morrow_ night."
