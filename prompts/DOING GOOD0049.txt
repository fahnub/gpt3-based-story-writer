An old woman, a young boy, and a lady went to visit a priest. The children have learned their lesson and will only use the carpet for good from now on. The speaker is asking whose castle is on the hill, and the poor lady replies that it has belonged to her family for hundreds of years but that she will have to sell it to strangers tomorrow. The passage describes a scene in which two people are buried in the snow, like St. Bernard dogs. They are rescued by a third person, who leads them to a hidden panel in an old German town.
