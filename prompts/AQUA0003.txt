Outline: Aqua is a water droplet who lives in the ocean with his mother. He grows tired of playing in the ocean and begs the sun to take him on a journey to see the earth. The sun agrees and transforms Aqua into vapor so that he can ride on the sunbeams.

Aqua has a grand time sailing through the air and looking down at the world below, but when the sun sets he grows scared and tries to return to the ocean. He falls back to earth and lands in a rosebush. The next day he tries again and this time he ends up in a flour mill, where he and his fellow water droplets work the machinery.

Eventually Aqua and his brothers end up in a river which leads them back to the ocean. Aqua is happy to be back home with his mother and tells her all about his adventures.

Story so far:  A man and his brothers run to a mountain brook and hear a strange noise. They find a flour mill and see that the big wheel is making the stones inside spin really fast. This fable is about a water baby who is both above and below the surface of the water, and is stirred by the life around him. The passage describes how water droplets become vapor, and how they can rise high into the sky. This passage describes the dangers that Aqua and his brother water-drops face on their journey around the world. Aqua travels to the ocean where he is embraced by the water-drops. Aqua is a drop of water who falls from the sky and becomes frightened as the sun sets. He tries to get back to the earth, and grows heavier as he falls lower, until he is a drop of water again, landing on a rosebush. This passage describes how water droplets can grind wheat into flour and corn into meal, and how they can also spin a giant wheel. The brook where they live leads to a pond where ducks and geese swim. The passage describes a scene in which a boy sleeps among velvet cushions and is then carried away by the sunbeams. The boy becomes tired and pleads with the sun to let him go back. Aqua jumps from the Ocean's arms and begs the Sun to catch him up and take him on a journey to see the earth. The Sun agrees and takes many other drops of water with him, turning them all into mist or vapor.

Last chunk: the white floating clouds; so, giving a jump from the Ocean's arms, he  begged the Sun to catch him up and let him go on a journey to see the  earth.  The Sun said "Yes," and took ever so many other drops, too, so that Aqua  might not be lonesome on the way. He did not know this, however, for  they all had been changed into fine mist or vapor. Do you know what  vapor is? If you breathe into the air, when it is cold enough, you will  see it coming out of your mouth like steam, and you may also
