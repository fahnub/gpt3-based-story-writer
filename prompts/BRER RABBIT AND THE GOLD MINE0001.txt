Outline: Once upon a time, the animals got tired of Brer Rabbit's antics and decided to hold a convention to stop him. Brer Fox offered a pot of gold to the creature who could catch Brer Rabbit, and Brer Buzzard said he would try. The other animals agreed, and Brer Rabbit was soon sent for to attend the convention.

Old friend Wobble-nose knew what was going on and warned Brer Rabbit. Brer Rabbit pretended he wanted to learn how to fly, and Brer Buzzard agreed to give him a ride. Brer Rabbit jumped on Brer Buzzard's back and they took off into the sky.

Brer Rabbit had a paw under each of Brer Buzzard's wings and when Brer Buzzard tried to drop him, he would scratch and tickle him. The other animals watched from below, waiting for Brer Rabbit to fall.

After a while, Brer Rabbit got tired of riding and steered Brer Buzzard back down to the ground. He then went into hiding, and when the other animals came looking for him, he was nowhere to be found. And that, as they say, is that.

Story so far: Brer Rabbit tricks Brer Buzzard into giving him a ride, then threatens to hit him if he doesn't comply. The other animals laugh at the pair as they fly off. The animals in the forest agree to go on one big hunt for the gold mine, and Brer Rabbit knows he has to be careful around Brer Wolf. A group of animals hold a convention to try and stop Brer Rabbit's pranks. In the fable, Brer Rabbit gets Brer Fox a horse. Brer Fox is amazed and delighted, and vows to never swim or wade across rivers again - he would rather ride a horse. A man comes down the road, coughing and sneezing. He affects all the animals, who all start coughing and sneezing too. Brer Dust nearly buries Brer Bear. A cloud crops up and Uncle Win and Cousin Rain get out. The race begins and Uncle Win blows his bellows. The animals held a meeting to discuss how to outdo Brer Rabbit, and eventually came up with a plan. Uncle Remus tells a story about a dry drouth that burned up the crops one year. If you had struck a match anywhere in that county, the whole place would have caught fire.

Whereupon he plunged headlong into a story without a word of explanation.  "Well, suh, one year it fell out dat de craps wuz burnt up. A dry drouth had done de work, an' ef you'd 'a' struck a match anywhar in dat settlement, de whole county would 'a' blazed up. Ol' man Hongriness des
