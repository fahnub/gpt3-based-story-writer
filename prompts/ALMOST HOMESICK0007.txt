Outline: Henrietta Hen arrives at the fair and is disappointed that none of the other chickens seem to notice her. She soon meets a chicken who informs her that she will likely only win the third prize, which makes Henrietta feel discouraged. She begins to feel homesick and regrets coming to the fair.

Story so far:  Henrietta has a strong voice, which she uses to good effect when she arrives at the fair and is asked by another chicken what she is there for. She replies that she has come to get the first prize, having listened carefully to what Farmer Green and Johnnie had said to each other during the journey from the farm. Henrietta meet a lady in the next pen who has never heard of Pleasant Valley or Farmer Green, which shocks Henrietta since she assumed everyone knew of them. Henrietta Hen is offended when her neighbor says that Farmer Green can't be of much account, and she declares that she would never live anywhere but on his farm.

Last chunk: the remark, "small potatoes," she didn't  understand it at all. So she inquired what it meant.  "It means," said her neighbor, "that Farmer Green can't be of much  account."  That speech made Henrietta Hen almost lose her temper.  "Mr. Green," she cried, "is a fine man. And I'll have you know that I  wouldn't live anywhere but on his farm!"
