Story so far: Alice and her friends see a light in the window of the house next door and decide to watch it that night. Noel speculates that the burglars chose the house because the people next door are grand and won't know them. However, it turns out that the light was just from the lady next door accidentally knocking over some flowerpots. Alice has noticed something strange and wants to ask Albert's uncle about it. However, the other children think she is just being silly and tell her to tell them what she knows. Alice agrees, but only if they promise not to do anything without her. H.O. tells Alice that she has to be much cleverer to find out strange and hidden crimes. Alice says that it is not very hard because when you read books, you know what the things mean. Dora says that she does not want to have anything to do with murders because it does not seem safe. The passage describes how two boys decided to watch the house next door for coiners, but decided that the girls should not be involved because it might be dangerous. The passage describes the difference between the heat in a tent and the heat in a house, with the former being called the "Turkish Bath" by Albert's uncle. The passage goes on to say that, despite not being at the seaside, there are still many things to be thankful for.

It is not nice to be kept from the  seaside, but we know that we have much to be thankful for. We might be  poor little children living in a crowded alley where even at summer  noon hardly a ray of sunlight penetrates; clothed in rags and with bare  feet--though I do not mind holes in my clothes myself, and bare  feet would not be at all bad in this
