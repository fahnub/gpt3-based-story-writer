Outline: Andras Baive is a strong and swift Laplander who lives in Vadso. The people of Vadso are very proud of their champion, and think that he is the best runner in the world. However, they soon hear of another Laplander, Andras Baive, who is said to be even stronger and faster than their own champion.

The bailiff of Vadso challenges Andras to a race, with the stipulation that whoever can jump over an eight-oared boat without touching it with their heel will be the winner. Andras easily wins the race, much to the dismay of the bailiff.

The bailiff decides to get revenge on Andras by challenging him to a race across a fiord. However, Andras is able to use his magic powers to transform himself into a reindeer and easily outrun the bailiff.

The bailiff, who is really a Stalo (ogre), is mortally wounded in the race and asks Andras to promise to give him an honourable burial. Andras agrees, and also agrees to take anything he finds in the bailiff's house.

Andras sails across the fiord in the bailiff's boat and finds the bailiff's dog and son. He kills the dog, as it is known that if a Stalo's dog licks the blood of his dead master, the Stalo will come back to life. Andras takes the bailiff's treasure and gives it to his son before returning home.

He marries a rich wife and they live happily ever after.

The winner gets a large sum of money. The passage describes a conversation between two people, in which one challenges the other to repeat a feat he has just accomplished. The second person is unable to do so, and the first chides him for his weakness. The passage describes a horse who transforms into a man, and then back into a horse again. He is on one side of a river, and the Stalo (a creature who is also on the other side of the river) is wondering how the horse will get to her.

'Ah!There you are,' cried the Stalo, appearing on the opposite bank;'for a moment I really thought I had lost you.'  'No such luck,' answered Andras, shaking his head sorrowfully.By thistime he had taken his own shape again.  'Well, but I don't see how I am to get to you1' said the
