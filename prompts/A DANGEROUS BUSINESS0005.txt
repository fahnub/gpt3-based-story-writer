Last chunk: can't be half as anxious to reach home as I am," Daddy Longlegs  remarked. "And if he doesn't go his fastest after I'm aboard the wagon I  hope Johnnie Green will whip him hard."  "Johnnie can't do that," said Sandy Chipmunk. "His father won't let him  have a whip."  "Well, he could cut a switch, I should think!" Daddy Longlegs exclaimed.  But Sandy shook his head.  "Johnnie's grandmother wouldn't let him do that," he replied. "But you  don't need to worry. You'll get home soon enough."  Soon
