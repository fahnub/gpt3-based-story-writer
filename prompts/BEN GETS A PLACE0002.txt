Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes a boy's encounter with the Duke of Wellington, and how the boy is not afraid of the Duke. The passage also describes a scene in which the narrator's horse, Duke, is being harnessed by a young ostler. The old Squire comes out and approves of the ostler's work, but does not say anything to the boy, Ben. A person is traveling from Ghent. Ben quickly catches a cup that Bab dropped, impressing her. He then proceeds to juggle two plates, again to the amazement of the girls. Sancho the dog is watching a cat clean itself and tries to copy it with his paw. His master Ben sees and laughs, and Sancho then licks his face enthusiastically. They hear a knock from downstairs and go to see what it is.

Last chunk: Sancho sat at the open window, watching the old cat wash her face, and  trying to imitate her with his great ruffled paw, so awkwardly that Ben  laughed; and Sanch, to hide his confusion at being caught, made one  bound from chair to bed, and licked his master's face so energetically  that the boy dived under the bedclothes to escape from the rough tongue.  A rap on the floor from below made both jump up, and in ten minutes a  shiny-faced lad and a lively dog went racing downstairs,--one to say,
