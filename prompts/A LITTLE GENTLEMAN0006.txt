Outline: The story is set in a poor, inner-city neighborhood, and revolves around the local Kindergarten. The protagonist is Patsy, a young boy who has been living a rough, tough life on the streets. Patsy is taken in by the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Kate, and quickly becomes devoted to her and the school. He takes on the role of caretaker and protector, and is a loyal and obedient student.

Patsy is also friends with Jim, another boy from the neighborhood. Jim is older than Patsy and is starting to get interested in girls. He tells Patsy that he wants to find a girl to marry, and Patsy helps him look.

One day, Patsy confides in Miss Kate that he is worried about what will happen to him when he has to leave the Kindergarten and go to "real school." Miss Kate reassures him and tells him that he is welcome to stay at the Kindergarten forever.

The story ends with Patsy and Jim getting married, and Miss Kate attending their wedding.

Story so far:  This passage describes Carlotty Griggs, a four-year-old African American girl, who the author says is like a butterfly in her joy and singleness of purpose. The author also notes that the other children are always entirely captivated by her antics. The Muley Cow heard a noise and knew it wasn't a woodchuck. Johnnie Green had thrown a stone into the bushes. The speaker greets Johnny Cass. The passage describes a child throwing kisses up in the air to her friend, Johnny Cass. The child explains that she did this so that he wouldn't feel lonely. Patsy tells the narrator that Jim is staying out at night this week because he is "looking up a girl." Dickie was a happy, carefree animal who had plenty of food to keep him warm and well-fed. Even on the coldest nights, he would play with his friends and have a good time.

Last chunk: he had a fine store of the very best that the fields and  forest yielded, to keep him sleek and fat and happy. So even on the  coldest nights, when the icy wind whipped the tree-tops, and the cold,  pale stars peeped down among the branches, Dickie scampered through the  woods with his friends and had the gayest of times.  No one would have thought that he had a care in the world.  [Illustration]      [Illustration]
