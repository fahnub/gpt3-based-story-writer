Outline: Buster Bumblebee is out collecting nectar from a clover patch when he is suddenly grabbed by what he thinks is a Robber Fly. He screams for help, but nobody comes. He is about to be eaten when he is suddenly released and falls to the ground. He hears a commotion and buzzing behind him, but he is too scared to look. He eventually makes it home, where he finds the whole family in an uproar. He learns that the Robber Fly did indeed come to the clover patch, but it was Peevish Peggy who was almost eaten, not him. He is laughed at by the other bees for his mistake, and he is never again able to mention the Robber Fly's name without feeling embarrassed.

Story so far:  Buster is released from something and barely manages to save himself from falling. He hears a loud buzz and hides among the clover leaves. The uproar eventually stops. Buster Bumblebee was tricked by Peevish Peggy and her companions, who made him think he had been seized by a Robber Fly. In reality, Peevish Peggy had seized him and then let him go when the Robber Fly came near. Buster Bumblebee learned his lesson about being rude to others after he laughed in the face of the Robber Fly and was met with silence in return. Buster climbs on a table and shouts for everyone to be quiet. He tells them that the Robber Fly attacked him and that he isn't the least bit nervous. Several of the family near him begin to titter. The Queen steps forward and tells Buster to hop down from the table. He obeys, but he is quite puzzled. No one seems to believe what he said.

Last chunk: climbed up on a table  and shouted for everybody to be quiet.  "I don't believe you know about me!" he cried, as soon as the house was  still. "The Robber Fly attacked me. But _I_ don't need to go to bed. I'm  not the least bit nervous."  Several of the family near him began to titter.  And the Queen herself stepped forward and commanded Buster to hop down  from the table at once.  He obeyed promptly. But he was quite puzzled. No one seemed to believe  what he said. And it was a long time before
