Last chunk: BOATS (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)    Hitch up your cattle    And drive to Seattle    To see all the boats come in,--    From Kibi and Kobi    And Panama Dobi    And some from the Islands of Myn.    They're bringing us rices    And cocoa and spices    And pineapples done up in tin,    And maybe Aunt Dinah    Will come back from China    If ever the boats get in.
