Outline: In this fable, Peter Mink is a creature who enjoys swimming and spends a lot of time near water sources in Pleasant Valley. One winter day, he decides to take a swim in the brook. Master Meadow Mouse, another creature in the valley, is also aware of Peter Mink's swimming habits and knows that he likes to swim under the ice.

 Master Meadow Mouse is determined to take a cold dip himself, despite the danger of encountering Peter Mink. He is careful, peeking out of his tunnel to look for Peter Mink before he ventures out. However, one day Peter Mink is too quick for him and Master Meadow Mouse is forced to retreat back into his tunnel.

Despite the close call, Master Meadow Mouse continues to take cold dips in the brook. One day, he is joined by a member of the Muskrat family, who are also aware of the danger of Peter Mink. The Muskrat gives a loud slap on the water's surface with its tail as a warning signal when it sees Peter Mink, and Master Meadow Mouse is able to safely enjoy his swim.

Story so far:  Mouse sees Peter Mink and knows that he is up to trouble. He decides to take the extra trouble of peeping out before he has his swim.

Last chunk: Mouse was never so lazy as that. And the day  came at last when it was well worth his while to take the little extra  trouble of peeping out before he had his swim.  For Master Meadow Mouse caught a glimpse of a snakelike head that darted  out from under the bank of the brook and darted back again, out of  sight. He knew that that queer head belonged to Peter Mink, and to  nobody else.  [Illustration]      [Illustration]
