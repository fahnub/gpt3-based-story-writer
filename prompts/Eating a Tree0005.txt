Outline: In a hard winter, food becomes scarce and animals must steal from Farmer Green's farmyard to survive. Master Meadow Mouse is advised by his cousin to get more food, and is directed to the orchard. His cousin tells him to eat the bark of the trees, and Master Meadow Mouse does so, finding it a filling meal. However, Farmer Green is displeased when he sees the damage to his trees.

Story so far:  Master Meadow Mouse is struggling to find enough food to eat, as the snow makes it difficult to access his stored supply. He promises himself to be better prepared in the future, but for now, he must rely on his cousins for help. Master Meadow Mouse seeks his cousin's advice on where to find more food, and is directed to the orchard. However, the cousin hurries away before Meadow Mouse can ask any more questions. Meadow Mouse eventually catches up to the cousin and expresses his frustration at being left behind. Master Meadow Mouse's cousin tells him that there will be trees to eat in the orchard, and then runs off. Master Meadow Mouse is confused, because he has never eaten a tree before.

Last chunk: "Have you been to the orchard and  back so soon?"  "No!" said Master Meadow Mouse. "I've been chasing you. I want you to  tell me what I'll find to eat when I go to the orchard."  "That's easy," his cousin replied. "Trees!" Having said those three  words he dashed off again even faster than before.  "Trees!" Master Meadow Mouse echoed. "I can't eat trees. I've never  eaten a tree in all my life. There must be something that my cousin  forgot to explain. So I suppose I'll have to run after him
