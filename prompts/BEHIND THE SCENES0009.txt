Outline: The story is about a woman who is a teacher at a school for children from poor families. She is trying to help a boy named Patsy who has not been coming to school. She goes to his house to find out why and meets his sister Hildegarde. Hildegarde tells her that Patsy is afraid of going to school because he is always late and gets scolded. The woman decides to try to help Patsy by encouraging him and paying him to come to school on time. She also tries to help other children in her class who are having problems.

Story so far:  This passage describes four cases of lost objects, and the speaker's frustration at the situation. Patsy had not appeared by Monday afternoon as expected, much to the disappointment of the narrator. The speaker suggests that if Miss Kate believes in Lafayette, he will do better. They say that her lack of belief saps his will power, and that instead of reproving him for being late, she should encourage him. The passage describes the author's longing to be transported back to their childhood, spent in nature, surrounded by happiness and companionship. The speaker says that if Mrs. Hickok sends them another child with chickenpox, they won't take in her two youngest when they're old enough. They also shouldn't give Mrs. Slamberg any aprons, and should try to find Jacob Shubener's hat. This passage describes a woman who is able to find beauty in the broken aspects of life. She is down-to-earth and finds joy in simple things. The woman in the passage is compassionate and caring, as evidenced by her willingness to help Mr. Bowker, who is not entirely mentally together. The passage describes tears as being like those of the weeping Jacob. This passage is about the author's feelings of guilt and sorrow for not being able to provide her children with the same opportunities for fun and play as other children have. She imagines how much happier and healthier her children would be if they could just enjoy simple childhood pleasures.

And oh! hardestof all to bear, I think of our poor little invalids, so young tostruggle with languor and pain! Just to imagine the joy of my poor, lameboys and my weary, pale, and peevish children, so different from thebright-eyed, apple-cheeked darlings of well-to-do parents,--mere babies,who, from morning
