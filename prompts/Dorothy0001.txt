Outline: Dorothy, Betsy, and Ozma are watching a magic picture that changes scenes and shows events happening all over the world. They see Button-Bright in Jinxland, and Ozma is worried for him because it is a part of her dominions. Dorothy and Betsy decide to go on a journey to meet the Scarecrow and the strangers in Jinxland, and Ozma gives them the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon. On their journey, they have many adventures and meet new friends. They eventually make it to Glinda's palace, where they are welcomed.

Story so far: The passage describes the arrival of the Woggle-Bug and the Scarecrow's refusal to let him read his Ode to Ozma. Billina tells the Head Booleywag that she is glad her chicks have a parent, because they will have more fun worrying her than if they were raised in an Incubator. The passage also describes a girl who is lost and is being led by a man. They come across a boy who is digging a hole. Dorothy meets Button-Bright on a road that winds through green meadows and fields. The Emerald City of Oz is a beautiful and magnificent city that is the center of the Land of Oz. The palace of Ozma is surrounded by a wall of glistening emeralds and is almost a city in itself.

Last chunk: Dorothy, Betsy and Ozma (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)      I suppose many of my readers have read descriptions of the beautiful  and magnificent Emerald City of Oz, so I need not describe it here,  except to state that never has any city in any fairyland ever equalled  this one in stately splendor. It lies almost exactly in the center of  the Land of Oz, and in the center of the Emerald City rises the wall of  glistening emeralds that surrounds the palace of Ozma. The palace is  almost a city in itself
