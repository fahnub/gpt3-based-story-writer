Outline: Fatty Coon is hiding behind some tall rushes near a creek, hoping to catch a frog.

She covers the eggs back up with sand, splashes back into the creek, and swims away.

He's happy that he got to eat the delicious eggs, but he knows he's in for it when Mrs. Turtle comes back and finds them all gone.
