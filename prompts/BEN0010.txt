Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

The boy is very thin and looks dirty, but explains that he had a wash in the rain last night. He says he's not sick, just hungry.

Last chunk: he might be sick and not  safe to take home.  The hand he gave her was very thin, but clean and cool, and the black  eyes were clear though hollow, for the poor lad was half-starved.  "I'm awful shabby, but I ain't dirty.  I had a washin' in the rain last  night, and I've jest about lived on water lately," he explained,  wondering why she looked at him so hard.  "Put out your tongue."  He did so, but took it in again to say quickly,--  "I ain't sick,--I'm only hungry; for I haven't had a mite
