Outline: Grunty Pig tumbles through a hole in a fence and is found by old dog Spot, who promises to show him twelve pigs without tails. Grunty is amazed to find that the pigs in the cage have no tails, and he accuses old Spot of trying to trick him. Johnnie Green, the owner of the pigs, comes out and tells them to leave. Grunty and Spot don't see each other for a week, and when they finally meet again, Spot is ashamed of himself for what he did.

Story so far:  Spot the dog leads Grunty Pig to a dozen pigs without tails and tells Grunty that he should ask Farmer Green to be like them. Grunty Pig and old Spot meet and have a conversation in which Grunty Pig asks old Spot why he doesn't have his own tail cut off. Johnnie Green comes out of the woodshed and tells them to get away from his guinea pigs. The old dog Spot tells the protagonist that the pigs they are looking at will never have tails, and that the protagonist should have their own tail cut off since they would be just as happy without one.

Last chunk: than any day-old pigs I ever saw.... Maybe  their tails haven't sprouted yet."  Old dog Spot seemed to choke over something. He turned his head away for  a moment or two before he spoke.  "These pigs," he said, "won't ever have tails. Not one of them would  know what to do with a tail if you gave him one. They don't want tails.  They have no use for them. And now that you see for yourself how happy  they are without tails, you ought not to delay any longer about having  yours cut off. I hope,"
