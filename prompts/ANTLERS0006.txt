Outline: Nimble, a deer, loses his horns and is sad, but he soon discovers that new horns are sprouting to take the place of his old ones. He is excited to show his friends his new horns, but he discovers that all of the other deer have new horns too. Nimble's new horns are antlers, with two points, and he is excited to show them off to his friends, particularly the other deer known as the Spike Horns. However, he soon discovers that the Spike Horns are all new deer, fawns from last year, and they are not impressed by his antlers. Nimble and his friend Dodger the Deer become known for their mock battles, which are quite realistic and exciting to watch.

Story so far:  Nimble loses his horns but manages to get through the winter without missing them too much. He eventually discovers that new horns are sprouting in their place. Dodger the Deer were known for their fighting skills. They could look and act fiercer than any of their young friends. Old Mr. Crow said it was worth flying a mile to watch one of their set-tos.

Last chunk: Dodger the Deer were known as the best  sham-fighters. They could look fiercer and act angrier than any of their  young friends. And the way they tore into each other was almost enough  to frighten you, if you had seen them.  Old Mr. Crow said it was worth flying a mile to watch one of their  set-tos.
