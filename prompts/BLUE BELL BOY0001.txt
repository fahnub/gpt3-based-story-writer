Outline: A mother has a young son whom she calls Blue Bell. She gives him simple tasks to do around the house, such as going upstairs to get a gold pin or going to the garden to pick some sage. Unfortunately, Blue Bell is quite clumsy and often winds up getting hurt in the process. One day, he is sent to the cellar to fetch some beer but comes back empty-handed, saying there is none there. The mother scolds him and sends him back to the cellar, where he presumably finds the beer and brings it back to her.

Story so far:  A boy named Blue Bell does various chores but gets into trouble when he falls while trying to get a gold pin and then again while trying to pick sage in the garden. He goes to the cellar to get beer but comes back empty-handed.

Last chunk: BLUE BELL BOY (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)  I had a little boy,    And called him Blue Bell;  Gave him a little work,--    He did it very well.    I bade him go upstairs    To bring me a gold pin;  In coal scuttle fell he,    Up to his little chin.    He went to the garden    To pick a little sage;  He tumbled on his nose,    And fell into a rage.    He went to the cellar    To draw a little beer;  And quickly did return    To say there was none there.
