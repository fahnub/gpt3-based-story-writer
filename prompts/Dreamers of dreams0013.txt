Outline: The Story Girl came up with the idea to have everyone in their group write down their dreams in an exercise book, to see who could have the most interesting collection. They began writing down their dreams, but quickly realized that they were all having the same dream. In the dream, they were in a dark forest, being chased by a Giant. They would all wake up just before the Giant caught them. This continued for several nights until they realized that the Giant was actually Uncle Roger. They confronted him and he admitted that he had been purposely giving them all the same dream in order to scare them.

Story so far: The passage discusses Felicity's Aunt Olivia and the possibility of her getting married. Felicity believes that Aunt Olivia will never get married because she is already quite old (29 years old). However, Peter argues that she might find someone who doesn't mind her age. Cecily and her friends are excited about the idea of a wedding in the family, and they point out the wedding veil of the proud princess in the sky. Dan and the Story Girl discuss Mrs. Richard Cook and her grandmother. Cecily and Peter are discussing dreams, and the Story Girl suggests that they write them down. Cecily is inspired by the idea, and they all agree to do it. The speaker loves words and cherishes them like precious jewels. She takes great care in choosing the perfect word for each situation, and is not afraid to experiment. Felicity, on the other hand, is more practical and down-to-earth. She thinks the speaker is being too fanciful and insists that they use a more suitable word in this case. Peter is angry with his father for leaving his mother and does not care if he never comes back. The Story Girl suggests that perhaps his father will come back with a fortune, but Peter is doubtful. Peter says that his Aunt Jane knew all the rules of etiquette, even though she was not from a wealthy family. Felicity tries to insult him by saying that his aunt was not a real lady, but he is not bothered by her comments. The passage discusses Cecily and the Story Girl's differing opinions on etiquette. The Story Girl is more lax in her views, while Cecily takes the _Family Guide_ very seriously.

Last chunk: failure of it.  "It wouldn't be ladylike to ask any one to marry you, you know," argued  Cecily.  "I don't suppose the _Family Guide_ would think so," agreed the Story  Girl lazily, with some sarcasm in her voice. The Story Girl never held  the _Family Guide_ in such reverence as did Felicity and Cecily. They  pored over the "etiquette column" every week, and could have told you  on demand, just exactly what kind of gloves should be worn at a wedding,  what you should say when introducing or
