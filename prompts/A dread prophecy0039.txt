Story so far: The passage describes the characters' reactions to the possibility that the world might end the next day. Dan is excited by the prospect of learning more about the Bible, while the Story Girl is sad that she won't have time to do all the things she wants to do. The boys are unhappy because the Story Girl is weaving a wreath of buttercups and Felicity is sipping from a cup of clouded blue with an air of unconcern. The girls in the passage are upset about the possibility of a fire, and beg the Story Girl to stay with them and keep them cheered up. Peter is upset because Roger went to Summerside and he is left alone. Dan and Felix decide to go with him. The Story Girl and Felicity are fighting, and the rest of the group is caught in the middle. The fight is causing tension among the group, and the Story Girl is trying to convince everyone that Felicity is nothing to her. The Story Girl says that if the man they met was trying to hoax them, he would have had a twinkle in his eyes, but she didn't see one. Dan says that if their father was there, he would tell them the truth, but the Story Girl points out that he would only tell them what he thought was true, not what he knew. Felix is scared because he read in the newspaper that the world is going to end tomorrow at 2pm. In the event that tomorrow is the end of the world, Peter and Cecily argue that there is no point in doing any more work. However, if their uncle still insists that Peter goes out to work tomorrow, they will know that he does not believe the end of the world is near.

"That is just the trouble," he said. "People won't believe it till it's  too late. I'm going straight to Markdale to pay a man there some money I  owe him, and after dinner I'm going to Summerside to buy me a new suit.  My old one is too shabby for the Judgment Day."  He got into his buggy and drove away, leaving eight distracted mortals  behind
