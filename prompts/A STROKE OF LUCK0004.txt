Outline: The story follows Jasper Jay and his friends as they tease and mock Solomon Owl. Solomon Owl is a big, strong owl who is usually very polite to people, but the blue jays know that they can tease him because he won't hurt them. Noisy Jake takes credit for finding Solomon Owl even though Jasper Jay was the one who actually spotted him.
