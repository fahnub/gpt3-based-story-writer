Outline: Uncle Tom is a slave who lives with his owner, Mr. St. Clare, far away from his home. He is not really unhappy, but he longs to see his family again. His little mistress, Eva, becomes ill and Uncle Tom grows increasingly worried and sad. The doctor is called and Eva improves for a time, but then her health takes a turn for the worse.

One day, Eva tells her father that she is going to die and she asks him to promise to free Tom when she is gone. Miss Ophelia, who has been trying unsuccessfully to reform the naughty Topsy, overhears their conversation and decides to give up on the child. Eva takes Topsy by the hand and leads her into a little room, where she tries to explain to her that if she is good, people will love her. Topsy is skeptical, but she is moved by Eva's words and she promises to try to be good.

Story so far:  The speaker is saying that it is a difficult question whether slavery is wrong or not, and that a lot of people think it is wrong. However, the speaker's child says that when she is dead, the speaker should try to persuade people to do right about slavery for her sake. Uncle Tom was very sad because he missed his family, and also because his little mistress, Eva, was very ill and growing thinner.
