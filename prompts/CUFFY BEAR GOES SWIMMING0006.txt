Outline: Cuffy Bear is being chased by bees and he runs to the brook to escape them. He jumps into the pool in the middle of the brook, but the bees follow him and keep stinging him. Cuffy has to keep his head underwater to avoid them, but he gets tired and has to come up for air. He tries to hide in a shallow part of the pool, but the bees find him and keep stinging him. Cuffy stays in the pool until sundown when the bees finally leave. He is very cold and his face feels like it's on fire, but he makes his way home.

Story so far:  Cuffy the rabbit is trying to escape a swarm of bees by jumping into a pool of water. The bees know they will drown if they follow, so they wait in a swarm above the water. Cuffy Bear rushes to the deep pool in the forest to watch the trout. On the way, he stops to bury his face in the leaves, but the bees bother him. Cuffy got tired from all the swimming, so he found a shallow place to stand where he could poke his nose out for fresh air. Cuffy is numb and cold, but his face feels like it's on fire. He can hardly see, but he's picking his way through the forest.

Last chunk: Cuffy felt quite numb from standing in  it so long. But cold as he was, his face felt like fire. And for some  reason, which Cuffy couldn't understand, he could hardly see to pick his  way through the shadows of the forest.
