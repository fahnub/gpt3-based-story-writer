Outline: The Bumblebee family is out in the meadow when they notice a jug. Buster Bumblebee is curious about the jug and goes to investigate. He hears a roaring noise from inside the jug and tells the other bees that there is an enemy inside. The bees all fly into the jug and are subsequently captured by Johnnie Green. Johnnie takes the jug and shakes it, then sets it down and goes to get more water. The bees inside the jug start to stir and eventually fly out. They are disoriented and don't know what happened. The other bees blame Buster for the incident and are forever remarking on how lazy and stupid he is.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green is pleased after he corked a jug that held angry bumblebees, breaking up their home. Johnnie plans to drown all the stinging insects on his farm, but is unsure about mosquitoes. He pours the contents of the jug onto the ground, killing many bees in the process. Buster Bumblebee and the other workers mistake a jug for the enemy, and they buzz around it menacingly. The workers decided that the whole trouble was Buster's fault and started to treat him worse. The passage describes how a group of half-drowned animals gradually revive in the sun. They never know exactly what happened, but the workers agree that it was probably a miracle. The passage tells the story of a group of bumblebees who become angry when they hear a scraping sound in their home. They rush to the front door to investigate and find a strange object close to the door. Buster Bumblebee joins the group and they all sail out into the open meadow to investigate.

Last chunk: A JUGFUL OF BUMBLEBEES (Fable Ages 3 to 5)    When the workers--as well as Buster Bumblebee--heard the raking, scraping  sound in the hall of their house they all stopped what they were doing  and shrilled "An enemy!" And with one accord they rushed for the front  door. They were terribly angry.  Not wishing to miss anything that was going to happen, Buster joined the  mob and went sailing out into the open meadow. And there, quite close to  the door, stood the queer object that Buster had
