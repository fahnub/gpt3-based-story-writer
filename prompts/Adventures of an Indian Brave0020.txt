Outline: A long, long time ago, in the west of America, there lived an old man who had one son. The son and his friends used to spend their days hunting in the forest. One day, they went out as usual to hunt, but the leader of the group killed most of the animals. They started back for the village with their game, but the leader left his pack on the bank of the river and went home another way. When the old man went to get the pack, he drowned and was turned into a piece of wood. The wood floated downstream and was caught by a woman who used it as a table. When she tried to eat off the table, her food disappeared. The woman had a baby that grew very quickly into a man. The man restored the woman's sight and then left to go back to his own home. On the way, he stopped to eat dinner with two old women. He gave them his hair, which turned into a fishing net, and caught some salmon. The old women told him to go home, and he got in a basket and was lowered into a deep hole. He fell asleep and was drawn up by the old women. The man continued on his way and finally reunited with his family.

Story so far: A man is put in a basket and told not to look out until he reaches the bottom, but he forgets and looks anyway. The basket then starts moving up instead of down. A piece of wood that was once a man floats down a river and is caught by a woman who plans to use it as a table. A man asks a group of old women to weave him a net, which he uses to catch fish. The women are happy to see him, but tell him it is time to go home. The man then sees a deep hole and is dragged inside. Two old women quarreled, and one of them suspected that there was a man present. The man revealed that he was their grandson, and offered to restore their sight. A father and son go for a walk, and the father points out a tree where some pretty new birds are perched high up. The son offers to climb the tree and get the birds for dinner, and the father agrees. But when the son begins to climb, the birds seem to get further and further away, and the ground below looks no bigger than a star. The son tries to go back down, but he can't. A man climbs a tree and finds himself in a strange, yellow world. He hears two old women crushing their food between two stones. The old man went to the river to fetch the pack but drowned in the process. The woman found a baby instead of the plank she was looking for, and decided to take care of it. The baby quickly grew into a man, and was stronger than any of the other tribesmen. The father tells the little boy how he caught salmon in the Land of the Sun.

Last chunk: forest, and the snow stood in great banks roundthe door, the father used to take the little boy on his knee and tellhim how he caught salmon in the Land of the Sun.          [From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute.]
