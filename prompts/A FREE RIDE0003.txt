Outline: Grumpy Weasel is hiding in a jug to escape Henry Hawk, when he is discovered by Farmer Brown. Old dog Spot smells Grumpy and starts to whine and yelp, but Farmer Brown cannot understand him. Farmer Brown loads the jug onto his wagon and sets off for home, with Grumpy still inside.

Grumpy Weasel is angry at being kidnapped, and even more so when he is left high up on a shelf in the barn. He escapes and gloats over old dog Spot, who was unable to catch him.

Story so far:  Farmer Green couldn't understand a word the weasel said, so he left him behind. However, his dog Spot wouldn't stop hovering around the weasel, so Farmer Green went back to see what was going on. Farmer Green picks up a jug and sets it in the back of his wagon, with Spot following. All the way down the road, Spot acts like a simpleton, much to Grumpy Weasel's anger. A weasel is hiding from a dog and farmer near some barrels. The weasel doesn't care if the dog makes noise, but when the dog starts running around and almost trips the farmer, the weasel gets worried. Farmer Green led a weasel into his barn and set it high up on a shelf. The weasel then crawled out of the jug and scurried away. A weasel is inside a jug and old dog Spot is trying to find it.

Last chunk: said Grumpy Weasel softly. "His yelping and whining  don't scare me. He can't get inside this jug of mine. And I certainly  shan't leave it so long as he stays here."  Meanwhile he could hear Farmer Green talking to old Spot, telling him  not to be silly.  "From the way you're acting anybody might think there was a bear around  here," he told Spot.  Old dog Spot explained to Farmer Green in no uncertain fashion that it  was no bear--but a weasel--that he was looking for. His nose told him  that.
