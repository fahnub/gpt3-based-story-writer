Outline: Captain Fyter was a soldier who fell in love with a beautiful Munchkin girl named Nimmie Amee. The Wicked Witch who didn't want them to be together enchanted his sword and he was gradually cut to pieces. He went to the tinsmith, Ku-Klip, who made him into a Tin Soldier. Nimmie Amee's tin sweetheart, Nick Chopper (the Tin Woodman), had disappeared and she took an interest in the Tin Soldier. They were going to elope on the day of their wedding, but the Wicked Witch came back and he had to stand in the forest rusting. The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Woot the Wanderer came across him and he told his story. They all decided that the Tin Soldier and the Tin Woodman should both go to Nimmie Amee's house and she could choose between them.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of a man who is planning to elope with a woman called Nimmie Amee. However, on his way to meet her, he is caught in a rainstorm and his limbs begin to rust. He becomes frightened and cries for help, but no one comes. The Tin Soldier and the Tin Woodman are discussing the Munchkin girl that the Soldier was in love with. The Soldier reveals that her name is Nimmie Amee, and the Woodman is surprised to hear this. They all then wonder if Nimmie Amee loved the Soldier back. The Scarecrow, Polychrome, the Tin Soldier, and the Tin Woodman all agree that the best way to find the girl a husband is to let her choose for herself. A Munchkin girl rejected a soldier, so he went to war and was captured by Mr. Rust, who turned him into a tin person. A woodman whose name was Nick Chopper lost his sweetheart to a tin man. The tin man appealed to her artistic instincts more than the woodman did. A man loses his body parts to a sword under a witch's enchantment, and a tinsmith makes him new ones out of tin. The speaker has been standing in the same spot for longer than he thought, and he is now deep in thought.
