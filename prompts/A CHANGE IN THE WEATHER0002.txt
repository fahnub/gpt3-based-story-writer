Outline: This is a playful poem about a child who is eager to eat their meal. The child is excited about the food they are going to have and the prospect of eating it. The poem speaks to the child's innocence and their joy in the simple things in life.

Story so far:  The passage describes a black and white dog who is particular about keeping his long hair neatly parted in the middle. Benny was a beaver who loved to dig holes. He was so good at it that other animals sometimes used his holes as homes. Benny dug so many holes that some of his neighbors started to object. The young black ram is on the farm and Snowball tells him to leave before the old dog finds him. Mr. Crow lost his taste for corn after Farmer Green came close to shooting him. He was worried that it would never come back to him, and he grew thin and his feathers began to look rusty. His friends were alarmed about his health, but his problem was that he was too careful. The passage describes a chant that is repeated over and over again, with some members of the group adding in a different version of the chant. In the end, the majority of the group wins out and the chant is accepted as truth. Mr. Frog is angry because he was not appointed to the committee that is asking Kiddie to join the Pleasant Valley orchestra. Long Bill tries to console him by pointing out that it is not cold today.

Last chunk: the  Pleasant Valley orchestra," Long Bill Wren informed Mr. Frog. "They have  no fiddlers, you know. And Kiddie will be a great help to them. Mr.  Crow has appointed a committee to call on Kiddie to-night and ask him to  come to the next concert."  That was the last straw, so far as Mr. Frog was concerned.  "Mr. Crow might at least have put me on the committee," he spluttered.  "But he has left me out in the cold."  "Why, it's not cold to-day!" Long Bill exclaimed. "Quite warm--I call  it!"
