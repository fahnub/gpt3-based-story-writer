Story so far: This passage describes Curdie's reaction to being taken to an old garret by his grandmother. He was disappointed by the room, which was nothing more than an old tub, a withered apple, a heap of straw, and a sunbeam. A man is being chased by cobs, when he is saved by a bird that slides down the slope of a globe of light. The boy is trying to find his way out of the mountain, and he thinks he may have found the right path. His father tells him it is difficult to tell where they are without a map or compass. Curdie plans to go back to the king's garden to see if the goblins are planning to attack the king's house. He is not afraid of them anymore because he has one of their shoes. Curdie tells his mother and father about the strange child he met in the mountain, and how he led her to him. His mother wonders how the child, who had no way of knowing where Curdie was or that he was even in the mountain, could have found him. A man is chased by cobs (wild animals) up a mountain, but is saved when a bird scares them off. The bird then disappears into a light at the top of the mountain. The man never has any more trouble with the cobs.

Last chunk: pigeon.  But whatever it was,  when the cobs caught sight of it coming straight down upon them, they  took to their heels and scampered away across the mountain, leaving me  safe, only much frightened.  As soon as it had sent them off, the bird  went gliding again up the light, and the moment it reached the globe  the light disappeared, just as if a shutter had been closed over a  window, and I saw it no More.  But I had no more trouble with the cobs  that night or ever after.'  'How strange!'
