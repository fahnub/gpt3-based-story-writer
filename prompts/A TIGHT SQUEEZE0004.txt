Outline: Fatty Coon is out for a walk when he comes across a turtle's nest. He's never seen turtle eggs before, so he decides to try one. Timothy Turtle, the father, comes home and is not happy to find Fatty Coon eating his eggs. He bites Fatty's paw and threatens to drag him down to the bottom of the creek. Fatty Coon manages to break free and runs away. He meets up with Mr. Crow, who teases him for getting into a fight. Fatty Coon swears he'll never see Timothy Turtle again.

Story so far:  In the passage, Fatty Coon pleads with Timothy Turtle not to pull him into the creek, as his mother would not approve. However, Timothy Turtle ignores Fatty Coon's objections and declares his intention to drag him down to the bottom of the creek. A coon has been caught by a turtle for stealing its eggs. The coon pleads for mercy, saying it was a mistake, but the turtle is not moved. The turtle threatens to bite the coon twenty-seven times as hard as it did before. Timothy Turtle likes turtles' eggs, and he thinks twenty-seven of them are even better. Fatty Coon is surprised by this and tells Timothy he's sorry. Old Mr. Crow and Fatty Coon are discussing Timothy Turtle. Mr. Crow insists that Timothy would have seized Fatty regardless, but Fatty is adamant that he never wants to see Timothy again. Fatty Coon is terrified of being buried in the mud and claws at Timothy Turtle's head to try and escape. Timothy Turtle manages to hold on, but Fatty Coon finally escapes and the water is churned into a muddy pool.

Last chunk: have lots of fun burying ourselves in the mud.  And I venture to say that you'll like it so well down there that you'll  never want to come up again."  If Fatty Coon was frightened before, now he was terrified almost out of  his wits. And he began to claw frantically at Timothy Turtle's head.  Luckily he had three free paws. And of these he made good use. In the  shallows near the bank he struggled with all his might and main. And  soon the water was churned into a muddy pool.  [Illustration:
