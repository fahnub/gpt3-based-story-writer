Outline: Freddie Firefly and Peppery Polly Bumblebee are flying towards a clover field in the darkness. Freddie is alarmed by Peppery Polly's song, which is full of threats to sting anyone who tries to trick her. When they reach the clover field, Polly begins to collect nectar from the flowers. Freddie Firefly tricks her by pointing out a "big blossom" that is actually a thistle. Polly is angry and tries to sting Freddie, but she is in too much pain from the thistle and can't. Freddie Firefly is surprised that Polly doesn't try to sting him and soon realizes that she is in some kind of trouble.
