Outline: Buster Bumblebee is out collecting nectar from a clover patch when he is suddenly grabbed by what he thinks is a Robber Fly. He screams for help, but nobody comes. He is about to be eaten when he is suddenly released and falls to the ground. He hears a commotion and buzzing behind him, but he is too scared to look. He eventually makes it home, where he finds the whole family in an uproar. He learns that the Robber Fly did indeed come to the clover patch, but it was Peevish Peggy who was almost eaten, not him. He is laughed at by the other bees for his mistake, and he is never again able to mention the Robber Fly's name without feeling embarrassed.

He realizes that she must be worried that the Robber Fly has hurt him, and he reflects that she is actually more kind-hearted than he had ever thought. Robber Fly tried to attack Peevish Peggy, but she was saved by other workers and is now resting.

Last chunk: Robber Fly came to the  clover patch to-day. And Peevish Peggy had a very narrow escape. If it  hadn't been for several other workers who happened to be gathering clover  nectar nearby, there's no telling where she would be now."  "Where is she?" Buster inquired.  "Resting in bed," the trumpeter explained. (Even Buster wondered how she  could rest with all that racket in the house!) "She's had a bad fright,  poor thing!" the trumpeter added.
