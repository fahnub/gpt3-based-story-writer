Outline: The Story Girl came up with the idea to have everyone in their group write down their dreams in an exercise book, to see who could have the most interesting collection. They began writing down their dreams, but quickly realized that they were all having the same dream. In the dream, they were in a dark forest, being chased by a Giant. They would all wake up just before the Giant caught them. This continued for several nights until they realized that the Giant was actually Uncle Roger. They confronted him and he admitted that he had been purposely giving them all the same dream in order to scare them.

Story so far: The passage discusses different people's opinions on etiquette. The Story Girl is more lax in her views, while Cecily takes the _Family Guide_ very seriously. The passage discusses the word "deviltry," which the Story Girl says is not swearing but is still a bad word. The Story Girl says that if she wanted a boy to marry her and he wouldn't do the asking, she would ask him. Felicity says that she would rather die an old maid forty times over. The boy in the passage is talking about his father, who was a smart man but is now living in the Maine lumber woods. The boy doesn't know where his father is, but he doesn't seem to care. Dan and Felicity are talking about Mr. Campbell's new horse, Betty Sherman. Felicity thinks it's not very nice to name a horse after a person, and the Story Girl says that Betty Sherman would have thought it was a compliment. The Story Girl scolds Cecily for not telling her dream better, saying that if she had the same dream, she could tell it in a way that would make everyone else feel as if they had dreamed it too. Uncle Roger is headed to the swamp with his gun, and the narrator and Felicity are sitting in a circle eating Rev. Mr. Scott's plums. The plums are in season and Uncle Roger's presence makes Felicity feel uncomfortable. The speaker and her friends imagine themselves as old ladies, laughing over their collections of stories. The Story Girl, however, is pictured as always being young, with her sleek brown curls, harp-like voice, and starry eyes.

Last chunk: them. We'll see who'll have the most interesting  collection. And we'll have them to read and laugh over when we're old  and gray."  Instantly we all saw ourselves and each other by inner vision, old and  gray--all but the Story Girl. We could not picture her as old. Always,  as long as she lived, so it seemed to us, must she have sleek brown  curls, a voice like the sound of a harpstring in the wind, and eyes that  were stars of eternal youth.
