Outline: Brownie Beaver lives in a village of beavers that is built in a pond. The houses in the village are all built under water, with doors that lead into a winding hall that goes up into the house. Brownie Beaver's forefathers built the village in this way because they thought it would be safer from enemies. The village has a dam that is used to keep the pond full. The dam is very old and is never finished because the villagers keep making it wider. Brownie Beaver is a young beaver who works on the dam sometimes. The beavers in the village cut down trees and save the bark and branches to eat during winter. Some of the food is stored in the houses and some is fastened under water near the dam. Brownie Beaver thinks his way of living is normal, even though it may seem strange to others.

The villagers kept making it wider, and it had to be kept in repair because bits of it would sometimes wash away. This passage describes a village of beavers who live in houses built in a pond. The beavers are good swimmers and don't mind that their doors are under water. If you had enormous, sharp teeth that could gnaw through a tree, Brownie Beaver would not want to meet you in a dark passage. The passage describes the consequences of neglecting one's dam. If the dam is not maintained, the pond will eventually dry up. This will make it difficult to store food for winter, as the ice will prevent access to the pond.

They would have had no place, either, to store their winter's food.For they were in the habit of cutting down trees and saving the barkand branches too, in order to have plenty to eat when cold weathercame and the ice closed their pond.
