Story so far: This passage describes various animals and their personality traits. Katy is a secret nobody knows about, except for Kiddie Katydid and his family. Many people remembered hearing her name mentioned the year before, but had forgotten about her until the Katydids brought her back to their minds in August. Grunty tumbles through a fence and runs to his mother, crying that a bear chased him. Mrs. Pig is excited and relieved that her son is not fat enough to have been caught by the bear. The passage describes how Mrs. Pig was delighted with the new improvement of the children eating in the most orderly fashion. Grunty liked the new way of eating, too. But Blackie made a great fuss. Cousin Rain and Brother Dust are racing, but Brother Dust falls down and can't continue. Mrs. Pig scolds Grunty for straying away from the farmyard and tells him that the bear chase was a good thing because it will keep him at home. Henrietta Hen has never been to a fair and doesn't know what to expect. She assumes she and her family will be put in a pen and taken there by wagon. The passage tells the story of how Hugh saved Little Red Riding-Hood from the wolf. This passage describes a situation where two holes need to be filled at the same time. The passage describes how a farmer outwitted a young pig who thought he would be able to get away with misbehaving. The farmer made a lid for the pig's feeding trough that had seven holes, one for each of the pig's seven children. This prevented the piglets from jostling at meal time. The speaker is grateful that it was their loved one who died, and not them. The black ram was angry at Snowball for laughing at him, but Snowball was no longer afraid of him because he had lost his thick fleece.

Last chunk: laugh at the black ram, and blat at him.  Now, the black ram was a peppery chap. He promptly lost his temper and  stamped his feet and shook his head at Snowball.  "I'll butt you for that!" he bawled.  Once Snowball would have retreated. The black ram had always been both  older and bigger than he. But now, though the black ram was still older,  he looked smaller. That, of course, was because he had lost his thick  fleece. He looked so much smaller that Snowball was no longer afraid of  him.
