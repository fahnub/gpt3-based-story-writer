Outline: Buster Bumblebee is out collecting nectar from a clover patch when he is suddenly grabbed by what he thinks is a Robber Fly. He screams for help, but nobody comes. He is about to be eaten when he is suddenly released and falls to the ground. He hears a commotion and buzzing behind him, but he is too scared to look. He eventually makes it home, where he finds the whole family in an uproar. He learns that the Robber Fly did indeed come to the clover patch, but it was Peevish Peggy who was almost eaten, not him. He is laughed at by the other bees for his mistake, and he is never again able to mention the Robber Fly's name without feeling embarrassed.

Story so far:  Buster is released from something and barely manages to save himself from falling. He hears a loud buzz and hides among the clover leaves. The uproar eventually stops. Buster Bumblebee was tricked by Peevish Peggy and her companions, who made him think he had been seized by a Robber Fly. In reality, Peevish Peggy had seized him and then let him go when the Robber Fly came near. Buster Bumblebee learned his lesson about being rude to others after he laughed in the face of the Robber Fly and was met with silence in return.

Last chunk: told these things to Buster Bumblebee actually laughed in  his face. And Buster was so surprised--and so crestfallen--that he  couldn't say a word for a long time.  And never again did Buster mention the Robber Fly's name.
