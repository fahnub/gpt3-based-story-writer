Outline: The speaker asks if the listener has ever done various things, such as going to the watering trough to watch the sparrows drink, or going to Potter's pond to see the divers sink. They then ask if the listener has ever stolen to the barn at night to watch the hoot-owls think.

Story so far:  The passage is a poem about playing tag with tigers and bears, and putting rats in a rain barrel to scare someone. However, if you get caught putting rats in the rain barrel, you'll be in trouble.

Last chunk: DID YOU EVER PLAY TAG WITH A TIGER? (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Did you ever play tag with a tiger,    Or ever play boo with a bear;    Did you ever put rats in the rain-barrel    To give poor old Granny a scare?    It's fun to play tag with a tiger,    It's fun for the bear to say "boo,"    But if rats are found in the rain-barrel    Old Granny will put you in too.    [Illustration]
