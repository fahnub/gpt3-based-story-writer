Outline: Fairy Tenderheart is weeping because she can't stand the fighting she sees going on in the world. Her sisters try to comfort her, but she is inconsolable. She asks an older fairy why men fight, and is told that they just do, and that there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Fairy Tenderheart is determined to find a way to help, and sets off on a journey to find the Oldest Fairy of All, who might be able to help her.

She finally finds her in a Magic Garden, and the Oldest Fairy tells her that the only way to stop war is with the Plant of Knowledge, which has the power to turn people against war. They set off to plant the seeds of the Plant of Knowledge in children's gardens all over the world, in the hope that they will grow up to be a new generation who will scorn war.

Story so far:  The Oldest Fairy and her sister take their Plant of Knowledge to the children's gardens to spread the message of peace. Fairy Tenderheart is hopeful that the children who see the plant will never tread it in the mud. She plans to take seeds to all the children's gardens in the world. The passage is about a person who is sad that their work will not be complete for a long time.

Tears are useless for fairies trying to help humans end war. Fairy Tenderheart stays to try and find a solution, looking across the world for a means to help humans achieve better things. The passage describes the author's pity for humanity, as we are the only creatures that kill our own kind. They wonder what can be done to stop the violence, but realize that there is nothing that can be done.

Last chunk: pity, but we cannot know what works in the hearts of men that they should gather in their millions to destroy their brothers and themselves. No other creature turns on its own kind and kills so terribly as man."
