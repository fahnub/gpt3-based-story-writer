Outline: Mr. Frog brings a present for Kiddie Katydid - an overcoat - all the way from the creek. Kiddie is pleased, but a little bit anxious, as he only wears green. Mr. Frog assures him that the overcoat is green and hangs it on a twig for Kiddie to try on later. He then goes back to the watering trough to wet his feet. When he comes back, Kiddie has already tried on the overcoat and loves it.

Mr. Frog tells Kiddie Katydid that he will go hang the coat up and wet his feet, and while he is gone, she can try the coat on. Kiddie Katydid is anxious that the coat is green, because that is her favorite color. Mr. Frog assures her that he will not make a mistake and then leaves.

Kiddie springs down from his tree and takes his new coat from the twig on which the tailor hung it.

Kiddie Katydid is offered a coat by Mr. Frog, but is hesitant to accept it for fear of being eaten. Mr. Frog is offended by Kiddie's suggestion to hang the coat on a twig, but agrees to let Kiddie put it on later.

And he was about to  jump down and slip into the coat when he noticed that Mr. Frog had an  extremely wide mouth.... Suppose, after slipping into the coat, he  should find himself slipping down the tailor's throat?  "Just hang the coat on a twig and I'll get into it a little later,"  Kiddie Katydid suggested.
