Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A young boy has a series of encounters with different animals, impressing those around him. However, the Muley Cow is unhappy with him for being too nice to Twinkleheels. The passage also describes a man who was beaten for spelling his name wrong. Ben is excited to go get him. Miss Celia gives the Italian her address and asks him to let her know if he finds Sanch. Nox, on the other hand, likes cold water, has white teeth and glossy hair, and is always well-groomed. The owl seems displeased when Benny Badger accuses him of being a joker, insisting that he's never made a joke before. Benny is surprised to learn that the owl lives in the hole. The passage describes two dogs, one of which likes to kill animals and the other of which saves lives. The second dog often risks its own life to save others, and it does this near a river where many other animals have drowned.

Last chunk: dirty hands; but Nox, if he had  been out in the mud, would lie down when he came home, and lick his  brown paws till they were quite clean. Benjy liked to kill all kinds of  animals, but Nox saved lives, though he often came near losing his own.  Near their home was a deep river, where many a dog and cat was drowned.  There was one place on the bank of this river where there was an old  willow-tree, which spread its branches wide and stretched its long arms  till they touched the water. Here
