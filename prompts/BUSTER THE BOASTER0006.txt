Outline: Buster Bumblebee is a young bee who is afraid of the Robber Fly, a fearsome creature that is said to lurk in the flower garden and clover field. When Buster's father is caught by the Robber Fly, the young bee is determined to find and confront the villain. After a long search, Buster finally finds the Robber Fly's lair and bravely faces him down. The Robber Fly is impressed by Buster's courage and decides to leave the area for good.

Story so far:  Buster Bumblebee was initially afraid of the Robber Fly, but over time he became less fearful and realized that the Fly was not a threat. The Robber Fly is a bold, bad villain that lurks on the ground, watching for victims. When he spots one, he flies quickly up and grabs them with his long, spiny feet. The passage tells the story of Buster the Bumblebee, who is afraid of the Robber Fly. He has heard stories about the Fly from his family and friends, and decides to go out and find him. When he does, the Fly is not as bad as he thought and they become friends. The robber fly has been gone for a while, and some people think he may be dead or have moved to another area. However, Buster boastfully claims that he isn't afraid of the robber fly and wishes he had gotten to see him. Buster's mother scolds him for being stupid. The Robber Fly has eyes that enable it to see very clearly, long and narrow wings that allow it to fly quickly, and a sharp, piercing beak. It looks like it could be related to Buster Bumblebee, even though it does not look like a typical fly. Buster Bumblebee is a silly boaster and is very young and stupid.

Last chunk: silly boaster.  "If you knew what happened to your poor father last fall you would never  want even to hear the Robber Fly's name mentioned again," the Queen  declared, as a shiver--or a shudder--or both--passed up and down her  royal back.  But Buster Bumblebee, being very young and somewhat stupid as well, said  "Oh, nonsense!" under his breath, so low that his mother, the Queen,  could not hear him.
