Outline: Master Meadow Mouse enjoys swimming and likes to live near water, so he and his family make their home in the low meadow near Broad Brook and Black Creek. Master Meadow Mouse is taught how to swim by his mother and quickly becomes proficient at it.

One day, Master Meadow Mouse meets Ferdinand Frog, a greenish gentleman with a wide smile and bulging eyes. Ferdinand Frog tells Master Meadow Mouse about the Pickerel tribe, the most dangerous fish in the creek, and warns him to be careful.

Mrs. Meadow Mouse is worried when her son tells her about his meeting with Ferdinand Frog and warns him to stay away from the slippery villain. She is even more worried when Master Meadow Mouse says that Ferdinand Frog promised to teach him to dive.

Fortunately, Master Meadow Mouse has enough sense to stay on the bank when he sees the Pickerel family swimming around the bend in the creek. He knows that it would be dangerous to swim with them.

He didn't have to be taught,
