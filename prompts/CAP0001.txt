Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

The passage describes a room with portraits of sea animals, mirrors on some of the walls, and peony-shaped furniture. There is also a bell cord that Cap'n Bill doesn't know is a bell cord. The General is upset because they are about to lose the battle and be humiliated. Captain Kidd tries to comfort her, saying it's not her fault and blaming Farmer Green instead. Zog has imprisoned the mermaids and Trot in a beautiful golden room. The room has couches for the mermaids to recline on, similar to the ones in their own palaces.

Last chunk: CAP'N JOE AND CAP'N BILL (Fantasy:- Ages 5 to 10)      The rooms Zog had given his prisoners were as handsome as all other  parts of this strange enchanted castle. Gold was used plentifully in  the decorations, and in the Rose Chamber occupied by the mermaids  and Trot golden roses formed a border around the entire room. The  sea maidens had evidently been expected, for the magician had  provided couches for them to recline upon similar to the ones used  in the mermaid palaces. The frames were
