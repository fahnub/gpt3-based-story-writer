Outline: Rusty Wren brings home a ladybug to his wife, Mrs. Wren, who is pleased with the insect. However, Rusty soon realizes that the beetle tastes terrible and drops it on the ground. Mrs. Wren is upset with Rusty for bringing home the beetle and scolds him. Meanwhile, the beetle is nowhere to be found. Mrs. Wren talks to her friends about the incident later and they all agree that Rusty must have made a mistake.

Story so far:  Rusty Wren brings Mrs. Ladybug to Mrs. Wren, who is pleased with the gift. Rusty is glad that he was able to find such a nice present for Mrs. Wren and goes off to try to find another one just like it. Rusty finds a beetle and wants to feed it to the children, but Mrs. Wren won't let him because it's not safe. Mrs. Ladybug tells her friends about her adventure of being mistaken as food by Rusty the bird. The bird drops the beetle it was eating after tasting it, worried the children it was feeding wouldn't like it either, and sure enough, when the Mrs. Wren tried to eat it, there was trouble. Rusty Wren goes home after being summoned by Chippy, Jr. and finds Mrs. Wren upset. Mrs. Wren accuses Rusty of trying to poison them and Rusty denies it. Mrs. Wren scolds her husband for bringing home pretty red beetles for their children to eat, saying that he should know better than to bring home food that isn't fit for them.

Last chunk: patience.  "When you gather food for the youngsters, never mind about the color of  it!" she exclaimed. "If you want to bring them playthings, that's  another matter. But don't fetch home any more pretty red beetles for  them to eat."  "Very well--my love!" said Rusty Wren. And then he slipped away to hunt  for food, because the children were still clamoring for more.  Mrs. Wren talked a good deal, afterward, about her terrible experience.  Yet she never stopped to think about the pretty beetle
