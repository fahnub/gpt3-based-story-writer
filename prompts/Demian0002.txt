Outline: Demian's  Fish  Soup  is  the  story  of  a  man  who  loves  fish  soup  so  much  that  he  can't  help  but  try  to  get  his  neighbor, Phocas, to eat as much as he can. Phocas, however, is full after just three platefuls and tries to politely decline any more. Demian is insistent, though, and eventually Phocas gives in and eats a fourth plateful. At this point, he's had enough and makes his escape, vowing never to come back.

Story so far:  The passage describes Demian feeding his neighbor Phocas, who is struggling to eat the soup.

Wife,  come  and  entreat  him!"  Thus  does  Demian  feast  his  neighbour  Phocas,  not  giving  him  a  moment's    breathing  time.  Phocas  feels  the  moisture  trickling  down  his  forehead.    Still  he  takes    the  soup,  attacks  it  with  all  the  strength  he  has  left,  and  somehow    manages  to  swallow  the  whole
