Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of Cap'n Bill and Cap'n Joe, who are both under water, and their efforts to move a stepladder. They are joined by Brownie Beaver, who is stuck under a tree trunk. The three eventually find themselves in the company of the "awful creature" Zog. Cap'n Bill and Cap'n Joe are long-lost brothers. Brownie Beaver is stuck under a tree that fell on him and tries to call for help. Daddy Longlegs wasn't worried when he heard the other animals talking about the dangerous valley because he knew they couldn't hurt him. Trot and Cap'n Bill discuss Joe after his awkward re-entrance. Cap'n Bill is worried that Joe looks so much like him, including the wooden leg. Captain Tickle had a nickel in a paper sack. He threw it in the river and couldn't get it back. Captain Tickle spent his nickel for a rubber ball. When he cut it open, there was nothing there at all. Cap'n Joe is a fish who used to be a human. He was shipwrecked and would have drowned if a mermaid hadn't found him and turned him into a fish. He says he's not too unhappy with his new life, although it is quite different from his previous one. Brownie Beaver begins to feel hungry and realizes he can eat the bark off the tree he started to cut down. He has a meal and then gets the idea to gnaw right through the tree. The Cap'n is talking to a sailor who he thought was a ghost. The sailor tells him that he is just looking after him, and the Cap'n tells him that he doesn't need a ghost. The sailor chuckles, and it sounds just like the Cap'n's chuckle.

Last chunk: ring a bell?" inquired the Cap'n, a  little ashamed of his ignorance and reassured by hearing the "ghost"  talk.  "It surely did," was the reply, "and Sacho told me to answer your  bell and look after you. So I'm a-lookin' after you."  "I wish you wouldn't," protested Cap'n Bill. "I've no use fer--fer  ghostses, anyhow."  The strange sailor began to chuckle at hearing this, and his chuckle  was just like Cap'n Bill's chuckle, so full of merry humor that it  usually made everyone laugh with him.
