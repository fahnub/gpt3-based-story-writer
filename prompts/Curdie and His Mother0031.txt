Story so far: A mother and child discuss the child's recent discovery that the royal family in the cave are planning to marry their prince (Harelip) to a sun-woman (one of their own kind). The child is excited by this news, but the mother is dismissive, telling her that it won't make her any wiser. Curdie's mother tells him a strange story in order to help him think better of the princess. Curdie kills a goblin with his pocket knife after a struggle, and is satisfied that the goblins are mining. The speaker plans to retrace their steps back to where they first saw the cobs, and then mark down on a piece of paper which turns they take, in order to better understand which direction the cobs are going in. A boy is talking to someone else about how he is not sure how to tell a girl that he likes her because he is a miner and she is a princess and he is not sure how she would react. The passage describes someone's belief that a group of people are trying to kidnap a princess by tunneling under the palace walls.
