Outline: Ben is an orphan who lives with his dog, Sancho. He is taken in by Miss Celia, who treats him like her own son. She promises to never send him back to the orphanage, and he swears loyalty to her. Miss Celia plays the piano to comfort him after he learns of his father's death, and he falls asleep.

Story so far: A woman's reaction to reading two letters is described in the passage. She looks sad and pityingly at a happy boy, and is then comforted by music. The woman offers to let the boy ride one of her horses, and he is excited to do so. The passage ends with the woman's face growing shadowed as she reads her letters. Miss Celia is telling Ben that she would have kept him before if she could have, and that she is happy to see him again. She also says that she will send Bab and Betty home with Baby for the night. The passage describes a young girl's experience of loneliness and her eventual acceptance of it. She finds comfort in the wind and the moon, and eventually falls asleep. The speaker is describing a woman who is always kind and forgiving, even to her enemies. She is compared to the good fairies in children's stories, who always bring happiness and blessings.

Last chunk: never smiled at his  mistakes.  So kind, so very kind was she to them all, that when, after an hour of  merry play, she took her brother in to bed, the three who remained fell  to praising her enthusiastically as they put things to rights before  taking leave.  "She's like the good fairies in the books, and has all sorts of nice,  pretty things in her house," said Betty, enjoying a last hug of the  fascinating doll whose lids would shut so that it was a pleasure to  Sing, "Bye, sweet baby, bye,"
