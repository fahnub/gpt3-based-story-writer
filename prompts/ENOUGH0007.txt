Outline: Mrs. Ladybug is trying to take Jennie Junebug to task for eating the leaves of Farmer Green's trees, but Jennie is too rough and knocks the breath out of Mrs. Ladybug instead. Mrs. Ladybug sends Miss Moth to find Freddie Firefly and ask him for help. Freddie Firefly comes up with the idea to ask Jennie why she doesn't bump into Solomon Owl. Jennie likes the idea and does just that. Solomon Owl is not amused and goes looking for Jennie. Jennie hides until he leaves, then announces she is moving away and is never seen again on Farmer Green's property.

Story so far:  Freddie Firefly persuades Solomon Owl to fly down into the meadow, where he plans to make Solomon Owl collide with Jennie Junebug. A ladybug is angry with a Junebug for bowling her over and eating leaves from a farmer's garden. Mrs. Ladybug is trying to figure out how to stop Jennie Junebug from eating the leaves off Farmer Green's fruit trees. Freddie suggests that she just talk to Jennie and explain how she's affecting the trees. Mrs. Ladybug sends Miss Moth to find Freddie Firefly so she can talk to him about Jennie Junebug knocking the breath out of her. Freddie comes right away, and Mrs. Ladybug tells him that she needs help. Mrs. Ladybug asks Freddie Firefly to speak to Solomon Owl about Mrs. Mosquito's rude behavior. Freddie Firefly boasts that he is not afraid of Solomon Owl and that he could get Solomon Owl to stop Mrs. Mosquito's behavior. Jennie Junebug leaves Farmer Green's place to live at the end of the valley.

Last chunk: as a mouse, herself, until Solomon had gone  back to the woods. Then she stole forth from her hiding place, showing a  battered face to her friends.  "Good-by, everybody!" she called. "I'm going to move. I'm going 'way  down to the end of the valley to live.... I'm off already," she added,  as she spread her wings.  Nobody ever saw Jennie Junebug on Farmer Green's place again.  And Mrs. Ladybug was more than satisfied.
