Outline: Cuffy Bear has gone into a cave to hibernate for the winter and Nimble the rabbit has promised to wait for him outside. When Cuffy doesn't come out after several hours, Nimble begins to worry and goes in search of help. He first asks Peter Mink, but Peter is uninterested and won't help. Nimble then finds Mr. Grouse, who tells him that Cuffy is most likely in a deep sleep and won't wake up until spring. Nimble decides to go to Cedar Swamp to get Fatty Coon, who is known for being a good tracker. hopefully he can find Cuffy before he wakes up in the spring.

Story so far:  Nimble has asked Peter Mink to go into a cave to fetch Cuffy the Bear, but Peter is unwilling, suspecting that Nimble is trying to trick him. Nimble explains that the snow has covered any tracks that Cuffy might have left, and points out that he himself is too tall to fit into the cave. Nimble has been left alone with Cuffy Bear, who is injured. He wants to send Peter Mink for help, but Peter says he has to go home. Nimble couldn't find help from Peter Mink, so he decided to forage for food instead. While he was nibbling on some plants, Mr. Grouse warned him not to step on him. Grouse confides in Nimble that he knows why Nimble was talking to Peter Mink, and Nimble asks if Grouse will stay to keep an eye out for Cuffy Bear while Nimble goes to get help. Nimble is waiting at a cave on a mountain for Cuffy Bear, who has gone missing. He is getting worried and looks for help, but there is none to be found. Eventually, Peter Mink comes along.

Last chunk: CUFFY IS MISSING (Fables:- Ages 0 to 3)    Far up on the dark mountainside, in the driving snow, Nimble waited in  front of the cave where Cuffy Bear had vanished. And all the time Nimble  was growing more uneasy. He feared that Cuffy Bear might be in some sort  of trouble.  Nimble looked all about for help. But there wasn't a sign of anybody  stirring, anywhere. All the mountain people seemed to have sought  shelter from the storm.  At last, however, Peter Mink came sneaking up from the spring.
