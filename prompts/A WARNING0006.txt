Outline: In the story, "A Warning," Timothy Turtle is visiting the beaver pond and is being rude to everyone he meets. He complains about the pond and the frogs, and says that he doesn't understand why anyone would want to live there. He also says that he won't be back for forty years.

 Brownie Beaver's mother is the fat lady that Timothy Turtle grabs by the tail. After she is insulted by Timothy, Brownie Beaver decides that he will make Timothy Turtle work.

The Beavers are always working on their dam, and Timothy Turtle often watches them. One day, a Beaver asks Timothy if he wants to help them, and Timothy gets angry. He says that he never has worked and never intends to.

 Brownie Beaver decides to put Timothy to work anyway. He makes Timothy climb a steep bluff, and Timothy falls and hurts himself. Timothy learns his lesson and decides that maybe he should try working after all.

Story so far:  Timothy Turtle is not interested in working, and he makes this clear to the others by snapping at the suggestion. He then proceeds to show his displeasure by making a pass at the person who had made the suggestion.

Last chunk: pleasanter for him."  "Don't you want to help us?" asked the brisk fellow who had told  Grandaddy Beaver that he thought Timothy Turtle ought to go to work.  That question actually made Timothy snort.  "_Me work_?" he snapped scornfully, as he glared at the speaker.  Everybody knew what he meant. And everybody knew how Timothy felt, too,  when he edged along the dam and made a savage pass at the plump  gentleman who had spoken to him.  [Illustration: Timothy began to climb the steep bluff.]
