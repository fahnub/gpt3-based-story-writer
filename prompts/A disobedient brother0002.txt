Story so far: The passage describes a fight between siblings Felix and Felicity, with the Story Girl trying to stop them. The kids discuss what it would be like to be a king, with the Story Girl saying that they don't have to wear crowns all the time. Cecily and Felicity are Grass and they are having a good time. Dan is up in his room, sick, and they feel bad for him. Felicity says that he deserves it because he ate bad berries when he was told not to. The passage describes how a group of friends tried to make up after a fight by sitting quietly and counting to 100. Cecily then went to find Dan andFelicity offered him a jam turnover. Felix gave Felicity an apple he had been saving. Uncle Roger is angry with the children for staying up late, but they explain that they are doing so because their brother Dan ate something that made him sick. Dan is disobedient, but his sister makes up for it by taking care of him and reading to him. Sara brings him a pudding. The speaker scolds their sister for being angry with them, telling her that she should mind her own business because they may be dead in an hour. However, an hour later, the speaker is still alive and well, and goes to bed. Dan is sick in bed and is feeding Paddy, his cat. He says that Paddy knows he is sick and is being extra affectionate. His siblings Felix, Peter, and Felicity are all doing chores around the house.
