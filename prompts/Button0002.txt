Story so far:  The Ork reflects on the question and says that he could carry one of the children on his back, but three adults would be too much. He suggests that they made a mistake in eating the purple berries so soon. The Bumpy Man shovels snow and finds someone buried in it. The shaggy man decides to call the boy Button-Bright, after his mother does. The passage describes a girl who is lost and is being led by a man. They come across a boy who is digging a hole. Dorothy meets Button-Bright on a road that winds through green meadows and fields. They don't see any houses or people for a while, but eventually they come across a farmhouse. Button-Bright insists that he has lost his magic umbrella and has no way to get back home to Philadelphia. The Mountain Ear listens to their conversation and says that he knows the boy. A pair of feet are uncovered and it is revealed that there is a little boy stuck in the heap of popcorn. Button-Bright walks with Trot and holds her hand. He is always quiet and composed, and nothing ever astonishes him. The little girl sees snow falling and is surprised by its size and shape. The Bumpy Man tells her it is snow and offers to take her outside to shovel a path. She goes with him and is amazed that it is not cold at all.

Last chunk: "and for that reason we get our heaviest snowfalls right here."  The little girl went to  the window and looked out. The air was filled  with falling white flakes, so large in size and so queer in form that  she was puzzled.  "Are you certain this is snow?" she asked.  "To be sure. I must get my snow-shovel and turn out to shovel a path.  Would you like to come with me?"  "Yes," she said, and followed the Bumpy Man out when he opened the  door. Then she exclaimed: "Why, it isn't cold a bit!"
