Outline: Frisky Squirrel is visiting Farmer Green's place and is looking for some beechnuts. He finds some beechnut shucks near the woodshed door and begins to nibble on them. Miss Kitty Cat, who is inside the woodshed, smells the squirrel and begins to stalk him. Frisky Squirrel smells the cat and tries to escape, but the cat catches him.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow tells Frisky the Squirrel to turn back because there is a cat at the farmhouse.

Last chunk: yellowing fields, caught sight of  the stone wall traveller and glided into a tree beside the road. "You'd  better not go near the farmyard, young fellow!" old Mr. Crow called.  Frisky Squirrel stopped, sat down, and looked up at Mr. Crow in the tree  above him.  "Why not?" Frisky inquired.  "Haven't you heard the news?" Mr. Crow asked him. "Haven't you heard  that there's a cat at the farmhouse?"  "I didn't know it," Frisky admitted. "But I don't see why I should turn  back. I won't hurt her."
