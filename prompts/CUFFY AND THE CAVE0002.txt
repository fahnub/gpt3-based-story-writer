Outline: Nimble, a young Spike Horn, befriends Cuffy Bear, a famous boxer who lives near Blue Mountain. One day, Cuffy invites Nimble to see his new home, a cave he's been eyeing up the mountain. Nimble is hesitant at first, but decides to go inside and wait for Cuffy while he looks around. As time goes on, Nimble starts to worry as the cave grows darker and snow begins to fall. He calls out for Cuffy, but there's no answer. Finally, he musters up the courage to go into the cave to look for him. Once inside, he finds Cuffy fast asleep. He wakes him up and they hurry down the mountain before the storm gets worse.

He then meets Cuffy Bear, who asks him where he lives. Nimble says he's not sure. Nimble the Spike Horn avoids playing with Cuffy Bear because Cuffy is a famous boxer with sharp claws. This passage describes the friendship between a deer and a bear. The deer, Nimble, likes to watch the bear, Cuffy, climb trees.

And Nimble liked to see Cuffy climb trees.  One day, late in the fall, that year when Nimble was a Spike Horn, he  strayed half way up the side of Blue Mountain. It was seldom that Nimble  wandered so far up the steep and thickly wooded slopes. But old dog Spot  was ranging about the lower woods. And for once Nimble did not run for  Cedar
