Outline: In this fable, Peter Mink is a creature who enjoys swimming and spends a lot of time near water sources in Pleasant Valley. One winter day, he decides to take a swim in the brook. Master Meadow Mouse, another creature in the valley, is also aware of Peter Mink's swimming habits and knows that he likes to swim under the ice.

 Master Meadow Mouse is determined to take a cold dip himself, despite the danger of encountering Peter Mink. He is careful, peeking out of his tunnel to look for Peter Mink before he ventures out. However, one day Peter Mink is too quick for him and Master Meadow Mouse is forced to retreat back into his tunnel.

Despite the close call, Master Meadow Mouse continues to take cold dips in the brook. One day, he is joined by a member of the Muskrat family, who are also aware of the danger of Peter Mink. The Muskrat gives a loud slap on the water's surface with its tail as a warning signal when it sees Peter Mink, and Master Meadow Mouse is able to safely enjoy his swim.

Master Meadow Mouse always waits an instant before diving into his tunnel, in case Peter Mink is around. He knows that if he doesn't check, he might never make it home.

Last chunk: waited an instant, but darted into his  tunnel without even stopping to shake the water off his coat. He said  that he could dry his coat after he reached home; while if he stopped to  dry it at the edge of the brook perhaps he'd never get home at all.  You might think that now and then he would have said to himself, "Oh, I  won't bother to look for Peter Mink to-day. He must be miles away. I'll  step right out of my tunnel and have my swim without taking a look-see  first." But Master Meadow
