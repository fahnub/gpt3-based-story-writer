Outline: Captain Fyter was a soldier who fell in love with a beautiful Munchkin girl named Nimmie Amee. The Wicked Witch who didn't want them to be together enchanted his sword and he was gradually cut to pieces. He went to the tinsmith, Ku-Klip, who made him into a Tin Soldier. Nimmie Amee's tin sweetheart, Nick Chopper (the Tin Woodman), had disappeared and she took an interest in the Tin Soldier. They were going to elope on the day of their wedding, but the Wicked Witch came back and he had to stand in the forest rusting. The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Woot the Wanderer came across him and he told his story. They all decided that the Tin Soldier and the Tin Woodman should both go to Nimmie Amee's house and she could choose between them.

Story so far:  Nimmie Amee falls in love with Nick Chopper after he gets his tin limbs, and they set a wedding date. The Scarecrow tells the Tin Soldier of all that has happened in the Land of Oz since he was last rusted in the forest. The Tin Soldier agrees to go with the Scarecrow to Nimmie Amee's house and let her choose between them. The Woodman and the Soldier are both in love with Nimmie Amee. The Soldier offers to let the Woodman marry her, since he cannot love her as he did before he became tin. Woot points out that one of them should marry her, since she likes tin men. The Scarecrow and the Soldier discuss the fact that both of them fell in love with the same girl. The Soldier says that he lost his ability to love when he lost his meat heart. The Emperor of the Winkies tells the Tin Woodman that he too had been disappointed in love by a tin woman, and that he understand why the Tin Woodman had wanted to marry Nimmie Amee despite her being a Witch. The passage tells the story of a man who is planning to elope with a woman called Nimmie Amee. However, on his way to meet her, he is caught in a rainstorm and his limbs begin to rust. He becomes frightened and cries for help, but no one comes.

Last chunk: day. Nevertheless I started out to get Nimmie Amee, because the Witch had been absent for some time, and we meant to elope before she got back. As I traveled the forest paths the rain wetted my joints, but I paid no attention to this because my thoughts were all on my wedding with beautiful Nimmie Amee and I could think of nothing else until suddenly my legs stopped moving. Then my arms rusted at the joints and I became frightened and cried for help, for now I was unable to oil myself. No one
