Outline: Brer Rabbit and Miss Bob White are having a conversation when Brer Rabbit notices that something is wrong. He asks what the matter is and Miss Bob White tells him that her eggs have gone missing. Brer Rabbit offers to help her look for them and eventually finds them in his own home. He tells Miss Bob White that he found them and she is very thankful.

The two animals know that something is wrong, and they believe that the Whipperwill and the Bob White are telling a sad tale. Brer Rabbit finds some eggs and decides to take them home and try to hatch them. Miss Bob White, after washing her dress, goes back to her house and sees Brer Rabbit. She thanks him and he bows.
