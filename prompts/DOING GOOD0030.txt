Story so far: A group of children find a treasure and are taken in by a hospitable woman. The house is small and dirty, but the children are glad to be out of the dark and scary passage. They find themselves in a room with a fireplace, portraits on the walls, and silver candlesticks on the mantelpiece. The lady in the passage is telling a story to the priest in French, and the Phoenix whispers to Robert that the priest thinks her troubles have turned her brain. Robert indignantly whispers back that he knows a lot of French. The passage describes Robert's foresight in hiding away some matches, which came in handy when the children needed them later.

The children are preparing to go on a carpet ride, and they discuss how they will have plenty of time to repent next week.

Jane is ungrateful, but the phoenix reminds them that they are not very little themselves. The passage describes a white house with green shutters and a slate roof. The house has a veranda with a vine crawling all over it. However, the vine is now dead, with only dry, reddish-brown stalks remaining.
