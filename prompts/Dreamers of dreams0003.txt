Outline: The Story Girl came up with the idea to have everyone in their group write down their dreams in an exercise book, to see who could have the most interesting collection. They began writing down their dreams, but quickly realized that they were all having the same dream. In the dream, they were in a dark forest, being chased by a Giant.

Uncle Roger is headed to the swamp with his gun, and the narrator and Felicity are sitting in a circle eating Rev. Mr. Scott's plums. The plums are in season and Uncle Roger's presence makes Felicity feel uncomfortable.

Last chunk: orchard with his gun on his shoulder, bound for the swamp.  We were sitting in a circle before the Pulpit Stone, each writing  diligently in an exercise book, and eating the Rev. Mr. Scott's plums,  which always reached their prime of juicy, golden-green flesh and bloomy  blue skin in September. The Rev. Mr. Scott was dead and gone, but those  plums certainly kept his memory green, as his forgotten sermons could  never have done.  "Oh," said Felicity in a shocked tone, when Uncle Roger had
