Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

Story so far: The shaggy man saves Dorothy, Polly, and Button-Bright from the Scoodlers, who wanted to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are two-faced creatures who live in a cave and chase after their prey. They are defeated when the shaggy man throws their heads back into the gulf. The Scoodlers are headless creatures who stumble around on the rocks. Toto tries to roll one of the heads down the hill, but the other Scoodlers pelted him with their own heads until he was forced to drop it. Dorothy is a little girl who is friends with the Scoodlers. The daughter and the shaggy man are captured by the Scoodlers. The Scoodlers demand that they submit, and the captives have no choice but to comply.

Last chunk: Daughter had both escaped the shower  of heads, but they saw now that it would be useless to try to run away  from the dreadful Scoodlers.  "We may as well submit," declared the shaggy man, in a rueful voice, as  he got upon his feet again.  He turned toward their foes and asked:  "What do you want us to do?"  "Come!" they cried, in a triumphant chorus, and at once sprang from the  rocks and surrounded their captives on all sides.  One funny thing  about the Scoodlers was they could walk in
