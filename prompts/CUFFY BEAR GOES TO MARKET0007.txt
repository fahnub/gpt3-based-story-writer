Outline: Cuffy Bear is planning to steal a pig from Farmer Green's pig pen. He knows he must be careful not to meet Farmer Green, his son Johnnie, or his hired man. Cuffy sees them all ploughing in a field and goes to the pig pen. He seizes a little white pig in his mouth and starts to run away. The pig makes a loud noise and Cuffy drops it and runs away. Cuffy is scared and decides he never wants to see or hear a pig again.

Story so far:  Cuffy is relieved to see that Johnnie and the hired man are ploughing in a field, and so he walks boldly into the pig-pen. Cuffy has a pig in his mouth and is running away with it, but the pig is squealing very loudly, so Cuffy is having second thoughts. Cuffy Bear is sad because he realizes that it will be a long time before any of the animals have a birthday and his father will be able to bring home another little pig for a feast. Cuffy Bear is curious about when his birthday is, and his mother tells him it is on the day the wild geese begin to fly south. Cuffy then asks about when Silkie's birthday is, and his mother tells him it is on the day of the first snow. The Bear family doesn't celebrate birthdays often because the day of the great forest fire is the only day their father can have a birthday. It's a lot like being born on February 29th. Cuffy the bear plans to steal another pig from Farmer Green, despite the many risks involved. Cuffy is terrified by the noise a pig makes, and runs away. He is so traumatized that he can't even stomach the thought of eating pork again.

Last chunk: sure he could  hear. Indeed, Cuffy thought that all the world must hear that dreadful  racket. And he was so frightened that he let go of the little pig and  ran away towards home as fast as he could jump.  That squealing rang in his ears for a long time. And if Cuffy's father  had brought home a pig that night Cuffy couldn't have eaten a mouthful  of it. He never wanted to see or taste of a pig again. And you may be  sure he never wanted to _hear_ one, either.
