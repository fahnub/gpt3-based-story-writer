Outline: Trot and Cap'n Bill are guests of the mermaids, and are given a tour of the undersea palace. They are shown to their rooms, which are furnished with beautiful things made of shells and seaweed. They are served a delicious meal by lobster waiters, and then entertaine by the mermaids.

The next day, they are taken by Queen Aquareine to see the most interesting parts of the ocean. Along the way, they pass by many fierce and terrible creatures, but are protected by the Magic Circle that the queen has drawn around them. They visit King Anko, the sea serpent, and then return to the palace.

Story so far: A man and a little girl are guests of the king and queen of the mermaids. The man is amazed by the sights he sees, and the little girl falls asleep. When she wakes up, she is surprised to see a number of fish staring at her. The queen takes Cap'n Bill and the little girl to the most interesting part of the ocean, where they see the King of the Sea Serpents. The little girl is entertained by the mermaids' singing and dancing after a feast. Cap'n Bill is bashful among the mermaids but is pleased when the queen offers him a seat next to her throne. The mermaids live in palaces that are lit by electric lights, which have been around for thousands of years. The little girl in the passage swims up to a circular opening and enters an upper room that is very beautiful. The walls are covered with iridescent shells, and the ceiling is covered with clusters of electric jellyfish. In one corner of the room is a white couch. The passage describes a room in a palace beneath the sea, which is decorated with polished tortoise-shell. The mermaid attendants help a child to get dressed in a pretty robe and brush and style her hair. They put a necklace of cherry-red seaweed around her neck. The captain explains that the pressure of the water increases the deeper you go, and that even divers in steel jackets can't stand it very deep down. The child wisely replies that the water doesn't touch them. The passage describes a journey to a palace.
