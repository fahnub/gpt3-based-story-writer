Outline: The story is about a fir tree that grows in a forest and aspires to be a Christmas tree. It is proud when it is chosen to be a Christmas tree and is happy when the children come to dance around it and sing.

Story so far: A fir tree is happy that birds are nesting in its branches and tells its mother about Christmas. The children were very happy to see the Christmas tree with all the presents under it. The good Fir-tree in the children's room is surrounded by flowers, mosses, and green boughs. From his branches hang toys, books, and candies. The passage describes how a tree is affected by the wind. The tree's roots grow deeper into the ground and the tree holds its head up proudly. The other trees in the forest do not try to grow as tall as the mother-tree.

Last chunk: how the wind bent and waved her branches,  but did not stir her great trunk; and as he looked, he sent his own  rootlets farther down into the dark earth, and held his tiny head up  more proudly.  The other trees did not all try to grow strong and tall. Indeed, one of  them said, "Why should I try to grow? Who can see me here in this dark  wood? What good will it do for me to try? I can never be as fine and  strong as the mother-tree."  So he was unhappy and hung his head, and let the wind blow
