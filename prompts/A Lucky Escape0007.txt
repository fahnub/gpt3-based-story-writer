Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is drifting downstream on a board, when he is spotted by Mr. Great Blue Heron. Mr. Heron waits for the board to drift closer, intending to pluck Master Meadow Mouse off of it. Master Meadow Mouse is terrified, and decides to jump off the board and into the water. He hides beneath the board, and when Mr. Heron gives up searching for him, he swims to shore and makes his way back upstream. He is met by his cousin, who scolds him for his recklessness.

Story so far:  Master Meadow Mouse was journeying upstream when he met his cousin. He explained that he was lucky to have been able to swim under water, as it allowed him to hide from danger. A mouse is trying to cross a river on a raft, but gets scared when he sees a heron coming. He slips off the raft into the water, and the heron flies away. Mr. Great Blue Heron is looking for Master Meadow Mouse, but can't find him anywhere. He's puzzled, because he knows that mice are good swimmers. A mouse escapes being eaten by a heron by floating downstream on a raft. The fisherman is disappointed when the Meadow Mouse he was chasing escapes on a raft. He goes back to fishing, but has no luck. He eventually gives up and goes away. The speaker's cousin warned him not to say anything that could be interpreted as an escape plan, because the cousin is the type of person who would say "I told you so."

Last chunk: escape," his cousin told him. "Don't say that I didn't  warn you!"  That cousin was one of those persons that always exclaim, "I told you  so!"  [Illustration]      [Illustration]
