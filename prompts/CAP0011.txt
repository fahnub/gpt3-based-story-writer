Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

"Cap'n Joe Weedles, formerly o' the  brig 'Gladsome' an' now a slave o' Zog at the bottom o' the sea."  "J--J--Joe Wee-Weedles!" gasped Cap'n Bill, amazed. "Joe Weedles o'  the 'Gladsome'! Why, dash my eyes, mate, you must be my brother!"  "Are YOU Bill Weedles?" asked the other. And then he added, "But no,  you can't be. Bill wasn't no mermaid. He were a human critter like  myself."  "That's
