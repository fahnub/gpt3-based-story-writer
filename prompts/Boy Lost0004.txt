Outline: Mrs. Rabbit's son Jimmy has been gone since early morning, and she is sure he is lost. She hurried through the woods, looking for him everywhere, but she can't find him. She happens to meet Jasper Jay, who tells her he saw Jimmy heading towards the gypsies' camp. Mrs. Rabbit is upset and asks for his help.

Jasper paints a sign that says "Lost, Strayed, or Stolen! A boy in a checkered suit, with a short tail and long ears. He answers to the name of Jimmy Rabbit. A reward will be paid for his return, and no questions asked."

Jimmy is at the gypsies' camp, but he hasn't been stolen. He's just been skulking around, interested in what he sees. He forgets to go home to dinner, but he starts heading home later in the afternoon when he gets hungry. He's surprised to see the sign and decides to hurry home.

Mrs. Rabbit is happy to see him and asks him where he's been, but Jimmy reminds her that the sign said "no questions asked." Mrs. Rabbit realizes Jasper Jay got her into trouble and asks Jimmy what he wants. Jimmy says he would like something to eat. Mrs. Rabbit scolds him and tells him the gypsies didn't give him dinner. Jimmy says they didn't, and Mrs. Rabbit realizes she found out where he was after all, even though she asked no questions.

Story so far:  Jimmy Rabbit is caught by Mrs. Rabbit after spending the day at a gypsy camp. He reminds her that a sign at the camp said "No questions asked" and that a reward would be paid for his return. Mrs. Rabbit gasps twice, realizing that Jasper Jay has gotten her into trouble. Mrs. Rabbit is upset after her son is stolen, and Jasper Jay tells her that the usual thing to do is to offer a reward. He helps her make a sign that says "Lost, Strayed, or Stolen." A boy in a checkered suit, with a short tail and long ears, is missing. His name is Jimmy Rabbit, and a reward will be paid for his return with no questions asked. Jimmy Rabbit's mother is worried, so he hurries home. He is just going to tell her where he has been and what he has been doing, but he decides not to when he thinks about what she will say. Mrs. Rabbit offered to pay her son a reward, and he asked for something to eat. Mrs. Rabbit found out where he had been, even though she didn't ask any questions. Mrs. Rabbit's son Jimmy is lost, and she asks Jasper Jay if he has seen him. He says he saw him by the river earlier in the day. Jimmy Rabbit was at the gypsies' camp, but he hadn't been stolen. He was interested in what he saw and forgot to go home to dinner. He started towards home later when he realized he was hungry.

Last chunk: was almost as Jasper Jay had thought. Jimmy Rabbit was at the  gypsies' camp. But he hadn't been stolen. He was skulking about, as near  the gypsies as he dared to go. And he was so interested in what he saw  that he had entirely forgotten to go home to dinner. But late in the  afternoon he began to have such a queer feeling in his stomach that he  remembered then that he had had nothing to eat since breakfast. And he  started off up the road, towards home.  You can imagine how surprised he was
