Outline: Johnnie Green and his grandmother are on their way to the miller's with a sack of wheat when they are joined by an unexpected passenger - Sandy Chipmunk. Sandy has stowed away in the sack of wheat and begins to eat his fill, intending to take the rest of the wheat home with him. However, before he can finish his meal, the sack is tied up and he is forced to ride along in the wagon, cowering in fear.

The ride is a bumpy one, and Sandy is terrified the whole way. Eventually, the wagon hits a bump and Grandmother Green screams. Johnnie begins to cry, and Sandy is even more scared. He has no idea what is happening.

Story so far:  Sandy Chipmunk begins to shake harder than ever when Green screams and Johnnie starts crying. Farmer Green captures Sandy Chipmunk in a bag and ties it shut. Sandy is so frightened that he can't eat. Farmer Green then harnesses an old, slow horse to the wagon. The passage describes Sandy Chipmunk's reaction to finding a bag of wheat. He hopes that no one will take it away before he has eaten all of the wheat. Sandy is not greedy, he just wants to enjoy the wheat while it lasts.

Last chunk: meal it  would be time enough to think of carrying some of the wheat away to his  house. He only hoped that no one would take the bag away until he had  removed _all_ the wheat. There was enough of it--he was sure--to last him  for any number of winters.  Now, you must not think that Sandy was greedy, because he wanted all that  wheat. He intended all the time to leave the _bag_ for Farmer Green.  The wheat tasted so good that Sandy Chipmunk could think of nothing  else. So he never heard
