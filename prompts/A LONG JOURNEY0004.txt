Outline: Ferdinand Frog meets a Great Blue Heron and is impressed by the size of his bill. The heron tells Ferdinand that he is moving into the area and Ferdinand is immediately worried that the heron will eat him. The heron reassures Ferdinand that he is not interested in eating frogs and the two become friends. Ferdinand is amazed by the heron's bill and says that it would be useful for making button-holes. The heron is amused by this comment and flies away.

Story so far:  The passage tells the story of a vain bird who is pleased when Mr. Frog compliments the length and sharpness of his bill.

Ferdinand Frog is relieved to find out that the huge bird he encountered is not a grizzly bear, but is instead G. B. Heron. Miss Kitty Cat frightens some birds by sharpening her claws against a tree trunk, then sets off for Pleasant Valley.

Last chunk: course Miss Kitty had to stay there for a time after that, to let the  birds know that they couldn't frighten her away. She scared them almost  out of their wits by threatening to climb up where their nests were. But  she didn't do more than sharpen her claws against a tree-trunk. That  alone was enough to throw them into a panic.  At last, after she had bothered the birds quite enough, Miss Kitty Cat  set off for Pleasant Valley once more. Sometimes she travelled through  fields; sometimes she
