Outline: Fatty Coon is a coon who likes to eat squirrels. The squirrels don't like him because he tries to eat them. One night, Fatty Coon climbs a tree in search of a squirrel to eat. He finds a hole in the tree and sticks his paw inside, only to be met with a sharp pain. He pulls his paw out to find that it was a tramp coon who had given him the pain. The tramp coon scolds Fatty and tells him to go home. Fatty goes home and never goes back to that tree again.

Story so far: This passage is a fable about a coon who meets up with two rabbits again after playing barber-shop with them. The rabbit brothers play a trick on Fatty Coon, making him wait all afternoon for them. They never come back, and tell everyone about the trick they played. Fatty Coon becomes known as a robber, and Jasper Jay is the most annoying of all. Fatty Coon was always hungry and would eat anything he could get his hands on, including bugs, snakes, and chickens. One day, after he had devoured all the fish his mother had brought home for him, he asked her if that was all there was. Mrs. Coon sighed, wishing her son would be content with what he had. Fatty was fond of bugs, and so when he saw one he put it in his mouth. However, the bug pulled him into the water and he was stung. Fatty nearly falls out of a tree and is scolded by an adult. He promised not to go near the tree again.

Last chunk: nearly tumbled  out of the tree. "You go home," he said to Fatty. "And don't you let me  catch you around here again. You hear?"  "Yes, sir!" Fatty said. And home he went. And you may be sure that he  let THAT tree alone after that. He never went near it again.
