Outline: The Beaver family visits Mr. Frog's tailor shop, but he always keeps the door locked and the shades drawn. They can hear him giggling and snickering inside, but he never responds to their knocks and calls.

A notice appears on Mr. Frog's door one evening, announcing a fitting day for the Beaver family's new clothes. The young dandies even spend the night in front of the shop to be the first to try on their new clothes.

When Mr. Frog opens his door the next morning, he has to beg his eager customers to keep order. He quickly gets them into their new clothes, assuring each one that they fit perfectly, and telling them to wait in the back yard.

When Mr. Frog follows the last Beaver into the back yard, he finds that there is a frightful uproar outside. Each Beaver claims that there is something wrong with his new clothes. Mr. Frog declares that they are exactly as they should be, because they are bound to be in style in five years' time.

Ferdinand Frog tells the crowd that they are only not used to being dressed in that fashion. One Beaver, however, shouts angrily that he knows his suit isn't fashionable and that he won't accept it.

Story so far:  The beavers are trying on their new clothes and Mr. Frog is hurrying them along. When they go into the back yard, they find that there is a big commotion going on. The tailor Mr. Frog took the measurements of the Beaver family, but then kept out of sight for a long time. The Beavers could hear giggling and snickering from inside the shop, but Mr. Frog never responded to their knocks or calls. Ferdinand Frog tells a crowd of animals that they look queer because they are not used to being dressed in such a fashion. One Beaver, however, angrily rejects his suit.

Last chunk: queer--as, indeed, they did.  But Ferdinand Frog told the crowd that it was only because they weren't  used to being dressed in that fashion. He said he certainly was pleased  with their appearance and that he had never seen any company that looked  the least bit like them.  There was one Beaver, however, who shouted angrily that he knew his  suit wasn't fashionable and that he wouldn't accept it.
