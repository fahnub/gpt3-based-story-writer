Outline: Once upon a time, the animals got tired of Brer Rabbit's antics and decided to hold a convention to stop him. Brer Fox offered a pot of gold to the creature who could catch Brer Rabbit, and Brer Buzzard said he would try. The other animals agreed, and Brer Rabbit was soon sent for to attend the convention.

Old friend Wobble-nose knew what was going on and warned Brer Rabbit. Brer Rabbit pretended he wanted to learn how to fly, and Brer Buzzard agreed to give him a ride. Brer Rabbit jumped on Brer Buzzard's back and they took off into the sky.

Brer Rabbit had a paw under each of Brer Buzzard's wings and when Brer Buzzard tried to drop him, he would scratch and tickle him. The other animals watched from below, waiting for Brer Rabbit to fall.

After a while, Brer Rabbit got tired of riding and steered Brer Buzzard back down to the ground. He then went into hiding, and when the other animals came looking for him, he was nowhere to be found. And that, as they say, is that.

Story so far: Brer Rabbit is hosting a race on a hot summer day, but a storm blows in and the child who was playing nearby runs to take shelter with Uncle Remus. Brer Rabbit tells all the other animals about the race, and on the day of the race, the two competitors start in the middle of the big road. Brer Wolf is chasing Brer Rabbit, but Brer Rabbit is too quick and escapes. Brer Rabbit is happy because he is going to get a new horse. Brer Rabbit comes by and sees Miss Bob sitting still. He asks her how she is and she says she's just keeping house. Brer Wolf, Brer Bear, and Brer Fox were all trying to find gold, and Brer Rabbit was pretending to find some too. Brer Wolf called Brer Rabbit over and Brer Rabbit said he was glad Brer Wolf found some. Cousin Rain and Brother Dust are racing, but Brother Dust falls down and can't continue. The passage describes how the animals fared during a famine. Brer Rabbit and his wife did the best because they had stored up some food, but the other animals were so skinny they haven't recovered even to this day. Rabbit is happy riding on Buzzard's back, because he can scratch and tickle him with his claws. When Buzzard tries to drop him, Rabbit scratches and winks his eye. With his claws, he steers Buzzard from post to pillar in the deep blue sky, hollering and laughing. Brer Rabbit tricks Brer Buzzard into giving him a ride, then threatens to hit him if he doesn't comply. The other animals laugh at the pair as they fly off.
