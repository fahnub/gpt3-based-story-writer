Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

Story so far: The explorers find themselves at the bottom of a deep well with an Ork. The Ork is cheerful, but the humans are dismayed. They all wonder how they will get out. The Ork offers to carry the humans up the well, but they are afraid of falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork escapes the well and is relieved to be in the sunlight again. The Ork tells the humans that he will take them with him when he leaves the cave, and the humans express concern about falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork tells Trot and Cap'n Bill that it can fly out of the shaft using its mechanical propeller tail, and proceeds to do so. The Ork and Cap'n Bill have been walking through a tunnel for some time and Trot has been sleeping. Cap'n Bill wakes Trot up and they start walking again, hoping to find an exit.

Cap'n Bill and Trot discuss whether the hill is an island, and Trot says that even if it is, it's better than the underground tunnels and caverns they were in before. The Ork agrees, and they all decide to be thankful for their escape. The Ork said they were almost at the end of the tunnel, and they didn't need to wake up yet. Cap'n Bill lit a candle, and they saw that they were at the end of the tunnel. Cap'n Bill and Trot discover that they are on an island after walking through a small forest.

Last chunk: Cap'n Bill and Trot decided to walk through the forest, to discover  what was on the other side of it, but the Ork's feet were still so sore  and "lumpy" from walking on the rocks that the creature said he  preferred to fly over the tree-tops and meet them on the other side.  The forest was not large, so by walking briskly for fifteen minutes  they reached its farthest edge and saw before them the shore of the  ocean.  "It's an island, all right," said Trot, with a sigh.  "Yes, and a pretty
