Outline: Farmer Green has a pair of oxen, Bright and Broad, who are very strong but quite slow. Twinkleheels, Farmer Green's pony, is much faster but not nearly as strong. The bays in the barnyard tell Twinkleheels that Bright and Broad are actually quite fast and could easily beat him in a race. Twinkleheels doesn't believe them and challenges the oxen to a race. Bright and Broad agree, but when Twinkleheels asks them if the bays were telling the truth, they simply say that he hasn't asked them a question yet.

But they said nothing.  Their jaws moved steadily as they chewed; but they said never a word.  "Can't you answer when you're spoken to?" Twinkleheels cried at last.  "Yes!" they said, speaking as one--for they always did everything  together. "Yes! But you haven't asked us a question."  "Is this true--what the bays
