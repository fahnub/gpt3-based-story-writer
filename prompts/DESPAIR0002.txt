Outline: The speaker begins by addressing their love interest, telling them to smile on them and shine their light on them. The speaker then turns to despair, saying that their soul is lost and they are willing to pay the price. The speaker continues, saying that their love interest is surrounded by beauty and luxury, while they themselves can only dream of such things. The speaker laments that they have forgotten everything but their love interest, and they pray to God to be as the happy, honest men in their graves.

Story so far:  The speaker talks about how they have forgotten the peace of nature, and how they long to be as content as the people buried in the graves.

Last chunk: whitethroat sings,    The quiet fields, the moonlight, and the dew,    The virgin's bower that in wet hedgerow clings.    I have forgotten how the cool grass waves    Where clean winds blow, and where good women pray    For happy, honest men, safe in their graves;    And--oh, my God! I would I were as they!
