Outline: Rusty Wren is a small bird who is very happy to have found a bunch of tobacco leaves in the carriage house on the farm. He goes home to get his wife so she can see it too, but she is uninterested. She shows him an egg in their nest and he is very happy, singing to her. They never mention the tobacco again.

Story so far:  Rusty Wren is angry with his wife for buying tobacco, but he soon realizes that he left the tobacco upstairs in the carriage house. This passage describes a moment when Rusty Wren peered into a bird's nest and found a large egg. He was so surprised and happy that he started singing. His wife seemed pleased, and from then on she stopped smoking. Rusty Wren was not afraid to enter any of the farm buildings, unlike old Mr. Crow. There was no reason for Rusty the rat to fly through the open window into the farmhouse, beyond the fact that he liked to prowl around and see what he could find. Once he was inside, he noticed something that had not caught his eye on his former visit: a cat hanging from a rafter. Rusty Wren returns home to find his wife sitting on their nest. She shows him something new - their eggs have hatched and there are now baby birds in the nest. Rusty Wren feels much better after eating three dozen insects and sings a few songs in thanks to the sun before it sets. Meanwhile, Farmer Green is still working in the fields. Rusty Wren finds a big bunch of tobacco leaves and plans to take it home to show his wife.

Last chunk: squarely upon it, was a big bunch of brown  tobacco leaves.  Rusty Wren gave a chirp of pleasure at the sight. That was where he  must have picked up the bit of tobacco that had clung to his tail  feathers and upset his wife's good nature.  "I'll go right home and get her and bring her here so she can see  this tobacco herself!" he said aloud. "Then she'll know where that  shred came from which fell on the floor." He did not say "which I  brushed onto the floor," for he never could remember long
