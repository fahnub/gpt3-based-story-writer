The guests see Miss Celia pushing her brother in a wheelchair and Alfred Tennyson Barlow tells her that he doesn't go to school. Miss Celia teaches the children about two dogs who are learning tricks. A German man teaches his horse to read and spell simple words in various languages. Sancho, a dog, is tempted by a tart lying on a red cushion. Despite his efforts to resist, he eventually gives in and eats the tart. Ben's father taught him how to train dogs when he was a young boy, and he has passed those skills onto his own poodle, Sancho. A small boy was discovered standing in the path behind a group of people, regarding them with interest. The passage describes the speaker's happy days at home, which are now gone. Miss Celia is amazed at the speaker's words, and the children giggle.
