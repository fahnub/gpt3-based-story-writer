Outline: In a hard winter, food becomes scarce and animals must steal from Farmer Green's farmyard to survive. Master Meadow Mouse is advised by his cousin to get more food, and is directed to the orchard. His cousin tells him to eat the bark of the trees, and Master Meadow Mouse does so, finding it a filling meal. However, Farmer Green is displeased when he sees the damage to his trees.

Story so far:  Master Meadow Mouse is struggling to find enough food to eat, as the snow makes it difficult to access his stored supply. He promises himself to be better prepared in the future, but for now, he must rely on his cousins for help. Master Meadow Mouse seeks his cousin's advice on where to find more food, and is directed to the orchard. However, the cousin hurries away before Meadow Mouse can ask any more questions. Meadow Mouse eventually catches up to the cousin and expresses his frustration at being left behind.

Last chunk: steps.  But at last he found his busy cousin again.  "You advised me to get more food," said Master Meadow Mouse. "But you  didn't tell me where to get it."  "In the orchard!" his cousin cried. And then he hurried away again.  "I wish he'd wait a minute," Master Meadow Mouse grumbled as he tore  after his cousin once more. "I don't feel like running. I haven't had a  hearty meal for days."  The cousin seemed surprised when Master Meadow Mouse overtook him.  "What!" that busy gentleman exclaimed.
