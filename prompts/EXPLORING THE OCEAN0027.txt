Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far: This passage from "The Sea Fairies" describes a meal with unknown dishes, which the child is suspicious of. Cap'n Bill eats everything without questioning it, so the child decides to do the same. They learn that the ice cream they are eating comes from icebergs. A sailor encounters an eel, which snaps at his face. The passage describes water as being alive and beautiful, with a variety of colors. The child in the passage sees the water as being like jelly, and is fascinated by its ability to move in any direction. The passage describes two fish guarding an avenue in a sea garden. The passage describes the lobster slaves of the mermaids, who are clumsy and often drop the food they are carrying. Trot finds them amusing to watch. Merla invites Trot and Cap'n Bill to visit some neighbors with her. In a clearing, they come across a group of floating creatures. The passage describes a room in one of Queen Aquareine's palaces, where a long table is laid out with gold dishes and dainty glassware. Around the table are rows of couches for the mermaids to recline on while they eat. Trot wonders who will serve the meal. The passage describes the sound of an Indian song, which gets louder as the listeners swim on. They eventually come to a big rock covered in tiny shells, which are making the chorus noise. The passage describes Trot's relief at being away from the eels, and Merla and Cap'n Bill's agreement that eels are not particularly pleasant creatures.

Last chunk: away and left our friends to  themselves. Trot was greatly relieved.  "I don't like eels," she said.  "They are more mischievous than harmful," replied Merla, "but I do  not care much for them myself."  "No," added Cap'n Bill, "they ain't respec'ful."
