Outline: Two cats steal some cheese and cannot agree on how to divide it. They decide to ask a monkey to arbitrate and he agrees. The monkey produces a balance and puts a part of the cheese into each scale. He says that one lump outweighs the other and takes a bite out of it. He then says that the opposite scale is now heavier and takes another bite. The cats begin to be alarmed and ask the monkey to give them their shares.

Thus  saying,  he  crammed  the  whole
