Outline: The Mice are trying to figure out how to deal with the Cat that keeps killing them. A young Mouse suggests that they put a bell around the Cat's neck, but an old Mouse points out that the problem then becomes who will put the bell around the Cat's neck.

Story so far:  The Mouse said the plan was good, but there was one problem - they didn't know who would put the bell around the Cat's neck.

Last chunk: An  old  gray  Mouse,  with  a  merry  twinkle  in  his  eye,  now  got  up  and  said    that  the  plan  of  the  last  speaker  was  an  admirable  one,  but  he  feared    it  had  one  drawback.    He  had  not  told  them  who  should  put  the  bell    around  the  Cat's  neck!
