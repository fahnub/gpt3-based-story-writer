Outline: Jasper Jay ignores Mr. Crow's warning and imitates Mr. Red-shouldered Hawk's cry, much to the latter's anger. Jasper hides in an oak tree in the farmyard, waiting to scare the hens with the hawk's cry. His plans are thwarted when Noisy Jake screams first, sending the hens and their chicks running for cover. Jasper gets revenge on Noisy Jake by sending him to a different tree, but is caught by the hawk himself.

Story so far:  Jasper Jay is chased by a red-shouldered hawk, but the hawk is more interested in Jasper than the hens and their chicks. The passage describes how Jasper Jay was planning to scare the chicks by imitating the cry of Mr. Hawk, but was thwarted when Noisy Jake screamed first, causing the chicks to scurry into the chicken house.

The speaker regrets imitating Mr. Hawk's cry, after he was warned by Mr. Crow.
