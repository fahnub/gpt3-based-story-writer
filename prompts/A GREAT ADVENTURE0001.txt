Story so far: The passage describes a black and white dog who is particular about keeping his long hair neatly parted in the middle. Benny was a beaver who loved to dig holes. He was so good at it that other animals sometimes used his holes as homes. Benny dug so many holes that some of his neighbors started to object. The young black ram is on the farm and Snowball tells him to leave before the old dog finds him. Mr. Crow lost his taste for corn after Farmer Green came close to shooting him. He was worried that it would never come back to him, and he grew thin and his feathers began to look rusty. His friends were alarmed about his health, but his problem was that he was too careful. The passage describes a chant that is repeated over and over again, with some members of the group adding in a different version of the chant. In the end, the majority of the group wins out and the chant is accepted as truth. Mr. Frog is angry because he was not appointed to the committee that is asking Kiddie to join the Pleasant Valley orchestra. Long Bill tries to console him by pointing out that it is not cold today. Mr. Crow is back to bother Farmer Green again, but maybe Farmer Green is smarter than Mr. Crow thinks! Mr. Crow likes to eat grasshoppers and cutworms, but he also likes his old home. He stays in Pleasant Valley until October, when he finally discovers that Farmer Green has only planted tarred corn in a border around the field. Mrs. Pig's family goes on an outing, but Mrs. Pig has a terrible time because Grunty runs away and she can hear him squealing getting closer.
