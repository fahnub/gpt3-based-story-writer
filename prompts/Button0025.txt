Story so far: The passage describes the meeting of three characters - the Ork, the Bumpy Man, and Button-Bright. The Ork reflects on the question and says that he could carry one of the children on his back, but three adults would be too much. He suggests that they made a mistake in eating the purple berries so soon. The Bumpy Man shovels snow and finds someone buried in it. The shaggy man decides to call the boy Button-Bright, after his mother does. Button-Bright is curious about the Ork's tail, and asks to see how it works. The Ork explains that it is his tail and he reserves the right to whirl it himself. Button-Bright then proposes they go out and fly somewhere so he can see how the tail works. The Ork declines, saying he only flies when he is going somewhere. Button-Bright is digging a hole when the shaggy man comes along and tells him that he should come with them.

The birds are initially reluctant, but the man assures them that he can make them big and strong enough to do it. They agree, and he proceeds to use his magic to make them large enough to carry the group.

Last chunk: Now, tell me: Which three of you birds will consent to carry  us?"  The birds looked at one another as if greatly astonished. Then one of  them replied: "You must be crazy, old man. Not one of us is big enough  to fly with even the smallest of your party."  "I'll fix the matter of size," promised Cap'n Bill. "If three of you  will agree to carry us, I'll make you big an' strong enough to do it,  so it won't worry you a bit."  The birds considered this gravely.  Living in a magic country, they
