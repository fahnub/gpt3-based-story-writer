Outline: Fatty Coon is strolling by a brook near his home when he sees a bright yellow and red bug land on the water. He reaches out to grab it, and is surprised when he finds himself being pulled into the water by the bug. He realizes there is a line attached to the bug, and at the other end of the line is a man - Farmer Green.

Farmer Green is just as surprised as Fatty Coon, and he starts to laugh when he realizes he almost caught a coon in his trout net. Fatty Coon is not amused, and he swims to the shore and runs into the bushes. He is relieved when the bug flies out of his mouth and takes the line with it. His mouth is sore from the fishhook, but he is otherwise unharmed. He learns his lesson and decides to stick to fishing for fish, not bugs.

He tried to swim away, but the thing wouldn't let go. Finally, it flew out of his mouth and took the line with it.

Last chunk: frightened? He jumped back--as well as  he could, in the water--and tried to swim away. His mouth hurt; but he  plunged and pulled just the same, and jerked his head and squirmed and  wriggled and twisted. And just as Fatty had almost given up hope of  getting free, the gay-colored bug, or fly, or whatever it was, flew out  of his mouth and took the line with it. At least, that was what Fatty  Coon thought. And he swam quickly to the bank and scampered into the  bushes.  Now, this was what
