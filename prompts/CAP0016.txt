Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

The passage also describes how Captain Kidd and the army are trying to move a stepladder, but it's too heavy. Cap'n Bill runs into Cap'n Joe, who is wearing a wooden leg. Cap'n Joe is happy to have run into Cap'n Bill, as he has often wondered what became of him. Cap'n Joe enjoys living under water and finds more dangers floating on water than soaking in it.

Last chunk: wear a wooden leg in time.  Mine's hick'ry."  "So's mine," said Cap'n Bill with a air of pride. "I'm glad I've run  across you, Joe, for I often wondered what had become of you. Seems  too bad, though, to have to spend all your life under water."  "What's the odds?" asked Cap'n Joe. "I never could keep away from  the water since I was a boy, an' there's more dangers to be met  floatin' on it than there is soakin' in it. An' one other thing  pleases me when I think on it: I'm parted from my wife,
