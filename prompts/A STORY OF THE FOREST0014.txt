Outline: The story is about a fir tree that grows in a forest and aspires to be a Christmas tree. It is proud when it is chosen to be a Christmas tree and is happy when the children come to dance around it and sing.

Story so far: A fir tree is happy that birds are nesting in its branches and tells its mother about Christmas. The children were very happy to see the Christmas tree with all the presents under it. The good Fir-tree in the children's room is surrounded by flowers, mosses, and green boughs. From his branches hang toys, books, and candies. The passage describes how a tree is affected by the wind. The tree's roots grow deeper into the ground and the tree holds its head up proudly. The other trees in the forest do not try to grow as tall as the mother-tree. A fir tree grows and becomes old and wise, listening to the conversations of the other trees and birds. The passage tells the story of a boy who asks the birds how a Fir-tree can be useful, and the birds explain that the Fir-tree could be used as the mast of a ship. The passage describes the tall fir trees in a forest and the sound they make when the wind blows through their branches. The ground is covered in sharp, brown needles from the trees, and there are also dried-out brown cones lying around. The fir-tree thinks of the birds, the mother-tree, and the little girl who said she would hear the fir-tree sing. The fir-tree becomes a Christmas tree and hears the children laughing and singing. The passage describes a tree that sings a song every day, asking for strength. Soon, the days begin to grow cold and the birdlings who were born in the tree's branches have gone far away to the South. The father and mother bird have gone too.

The birdlings who had been born in  the Fir-tree's branches had gone far away to the South. The father and  mother bird had gone too, and on the way had stopped
