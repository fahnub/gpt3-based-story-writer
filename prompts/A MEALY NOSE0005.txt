Outline: The bays in the barn are annoyed with Twinkleheels the pony because they think he is a lazy loafer who is always eating. Twinkleheels tries to explain that his mealy nose doesn't mean he's been eating meal, but the bays don't believe him.

One day, the bays are forced to walk on the tread mill for thrashing, and they are not happy about it. Twinkleheels tries to talk to them, but the thrashing machine is too loud for them to hear him.

Johnnie Green comes to the field and feeds Twinkleheels some of the newly thrashed oats. The bays see this and they are envious.

One of the bays says to his mate, "That pony has begun to eat up the new oats already. I hoped he'd have the decency to decline them when Johnnie Green offered him a taste."

Story so far:  This passage describes how a group of horses are angry with a pony named Twinkleheels for not helping with the thrashing, and Twinkleheels insists that he would like to help but Farmer Green would never allow it. The speaker's mate groans that the pony "even hinted to Johnnie Green that he'd like some oats." The speaker replies that the pony is "mealy-mouthed as well!" The horses in the stable are annoyed with Twinkleheels, who is always eating something. Yesterday, they saw him eat a potato that Mrs. Green gave him. The bays think that Twinkleheels has been eating meal because he has a mealy nose, but he explains that his nose is just the color of meal and that he hasn't actually been eating it. The bays don't believe him. Ebenezer scolds the bays for being rude to Twinkleheels, and explains that mealy noses are not uncommon. The bays' bay mate echoes their complaint that Twinkleheels is always feeding them, and Twinkleheels explains that it would be impolite to decline. Farmer Green comes in and backs the bays out of their stalls, and they both sigh, knowing they're going to be made to walk on the tread.

Last chunk: always feeding you," echoed the bay's bay mate.  "How can I help that?" Twinkleheels asked them.  "You could decline with thanks," they explained.  Twinkleheels shook his head.  "It wouldn't be polite," he said. "Besides, I like potatoes and apples  and carrots even more than oats and hay."  Just then Farmer Green came into the barn and backed the bays out of  their stalls. They both sighed.  "We're in for it now," they told Ebenezer. "He's going to take us out  and make us walk on the tread
