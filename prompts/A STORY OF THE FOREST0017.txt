Outline: The story is about a fir tree that grows in a forest and aspires to be a Christmas tree. It is proud when it is chosen to be a Christmas tree and is happy when the children come to dance around it and sing.

The fir-tree thinks of the birds, the mother-tree, and the little girl who said she would hear the fir-tree sing. The fir-tree becomes a Christmas tree and hears the children laughing and singing.

But suddenly, one day, he heard something far away that sounded like the  ringing of Christmas bells. It was the children laughing and singing, as  they ran over the snow.  Nearer they
