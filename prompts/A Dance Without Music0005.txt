Outline: Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon attend a Rabbits' Ball without being invited. The guests are all blindfolded, and the dance is to be without music.

He tore the handkerchief off his eyes. And  Tommy Fox was just as quick. He saw that he had made an unwise speech.  And he snatched the bandage from his own face.  "You've played a trick on me!" Tommy Fox cried, when he saw that all the  other dancers--and the fiddlers, too--had gone.  "You've played one on me!" Fatty Coon shouted. And he
