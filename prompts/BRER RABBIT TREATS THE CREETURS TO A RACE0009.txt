Outline: A group of animals are racing to Moscow before the close of day. The first to leave is a butterfly riding on a frog. Next is a water rat floating on a log, followed by a caterpillar on the fence and a hopper in the hay. The animals all race as fast as they can, but it's unclear who will make it to Moscow first.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow is proud that he can fly faster than the trains. One day, he waited for a train to pass and boasted that it could not beat him. Brer Rabbit is hosting a race on a hot summer day. A storm blows in, and the child who was playing nearby runs to take shelter with Uncle Remus. The passage describes how Brer Rabbit got covered in mud while being chased by Brer Dust, but was able to clean himself off while the other animals were still covered in mud. This made the other animals mad, and they all went after Brer Rabbit. Old Mr. Crow was fond of bright colors, and his neighbors could usually identify him by a quick glimpse of his red or yellow coat. Brer Rabbit and the Rainmaker agree to have a race, with the Rainmaker only agreeing because Brer Rabbit is the challenger. Brer Rabbit tells all the other animals about the race, and on the day of the race, the two competitors start in the middle of the big road. The passage describes a train making a loud hissing noise, which startled a crow perched in a nearby tree. Two men jumped down from the engine and walked along the track, before crawling back in and continuing on. The crow mused that it must have been angry because it lost to the bird in a race, and decides to come back and race it again tomorrow. Cousin Rain and Brother Dust are racing, but Brother Dust falls down and can't continue.

Last chunk: Cousin Rain can't see nothin' er Brother Dust, he thunk he am beat, but he holla out, 'Brer Dust, wharbouts is you?' an' Brer Dust he holla back, 'You'll hatter scuzen me; I fell down in de mud an' can't run no mo'!'"
