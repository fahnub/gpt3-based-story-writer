Story so far: A man named Esben is captured by a witch and put in a dark hole to fatten him up, but his daughter eventually grows to like her captor and decides not to kill him. The king gives Esben's brothers three days to bring him a marvellous boar, and Esben helps them. The three brothers escape the witch's house and ride to a king's palace, where they are hired as stablemen. Esben steals the witch's gold and silver boar, and she chases after him, asking if he also stole her dove and made her kill her children. The passage tells the story of a witch who is destroyed by a boy who uses her own magic against her. The witch's daughter is told by Esben to give her mother an iron nail wrapped in skin to bite, which she does. However, the witch cries out that it is only skin and bone and Esben must be fattened more. So he is fed sweet milk and nut-kernels until the witch believes he is fat enough. The passage tells the story of a king who wants a special dove with feathers of gold and silver. His brothers say they can get it for him, but only if they are threatened with death. The king then has the brothers called before him and accuses them of lying. The brothers deny the accusation and insist that such a dove does not exist. SirRed is angry and jealous of the brothers, and plans to get them into trouble. He tells the king that they can get a lamp that will shine over seven kingdoms, and the king orders them to bring it to him.
