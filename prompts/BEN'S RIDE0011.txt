Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes a competition, a boy's abuse of animals, and a doctor's house visit. Ben is grateful for Thorny's friendship but feels sad because it comes so soon after another loss. The boys in the passage are disappointed to hear that their cousin was unable to find their lost dog. The owner of the black poodle they find says he bought the dog from a stranger and is also upset at the loss of the animal. Thorny is confident that Ben will win an archery competition against Bab, despite Bab having been taught by Celia. Ben is disconsolate after his dog dies, and Thorny tries to cheer him up. A child, who has run away after being beaten, is too tired to go any further. He hopes the people at the big house will take him in. The passage describes a horse that has come back to its owner after running away and falling. The horse is not injured, and the owner is relieved. Thorny goes off to try and find the lost dog, and half an hour later is roused by the sound of a hand-organ in the avenue. The passage describes Betty and Bab's love of horses and their desire to ride them. Betty is upset because the judge won't let them pull a few hairs out of old Major's tail to make rings of. The passage describes a scene in which a man is taking a nap in the grass, watched by children. Miss Celia comes out and talks to him in Italian, which delights him.

Last chunk: with bread and milk, and allowed to curl  himself up in the cool grass for a nap, looking so like a tired littie  old man in a fur coat that the children were never weary of watching  him.  Meantime, Miss Celia had come out, and was talking Italian to Giacomo in  a way that delighted his homesick heart. She had been to Naples, and  could understand his longing for the lovely city of his birth, so they  had a little chat in the language which is all Music, and the good  fellow was so grateful
