Outline: As time goes on, Betsy Butterfly grows increasingly fond of Joseph Bumble, despite the fact that she never sees him with his cousin Buster Bumblebee. Finally, she asks him why they never seem to hang out together, and Joseph explains that they have different interests and that he would much rather spend time with her than with Buster.
