Outline: Mrs. Ladybug tells Freddie Firefly that he should spend his nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the trains. Freddie is hesitant at first, but Mrs. Ladybug assures him that he will be able to stop the trains before they run over him. Freddie decides to try it out and sets off for the railroad track. When he gets there, he waves his light in front of an oncoming train. The train does not stop and Freddie is killed.

Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug tells Freddie Firefly that he should stop worrying and start working if he doesn't want to waste his time. Freddie is doubtful about whether he can fly all the way to the railroad, but Mrs. Ladybug insists that he can. Freddie Firefly liked Mrs. Ladybug's idea, and though he knew she was mistaken about some things, he began to think she was quite wise. A man sees a ladybug and waves at her as he walks towards the village. In this fable, Freddie Firefly asks little Mrs. Ladybug what could happen if the wind blew out his light. Mrs. Ladybug replies that the train would strike him and be wrecked. She explains that she has everything planned for him, and that he will spend his nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the trains. A firefly is telling a moth how easy it is to catch a train, but the moth is worried that the train might not stop in time.

Last chunk: "When a train came  along you would stand on the track right in front of it and wave your  light." And while she smiled at Freddie Firefly as if to say, "You see  how easy it is," she dropped six more stitches out of her knitting--and  never found them, either.  Freddie Firefly, however, did not smile at all. On the contrary, he  looked somewhat worried.  "Are you sure it's safe?" he asked her. "If the train failed to stop,  with me on the track in front of it--"  "Don't worry about that!" cried
