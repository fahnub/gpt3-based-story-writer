Johnnie Green, who lives in the farmhouse nearby, notices the commotion and comes to investigate. When he learns that there is a chippy sparrow inside Rusty's house, he shinned up the old cherry tree to take a look. He saw Chippy, Jr.'s head peeking out of the syrup can and called down to his father to tell him.

Johnnie Green bent the tin back into place and Rusty and his wife discovered that Johnnie was a good friend to have.
