Outline: A crowd of animals has gathered at Farmer Green's house to watch the races and other sports that have been organized by Benjamin Bat. Among the crowd is Mr. Frog, who is trying to be the center of attention and is objecting to every arrangement that Benjamin has made.

Kiddie Katydid is hiding among the leaves, listening to the conversations and occasionally talking to the other animals. When Mr. Frog suggests a swimming contest, Kiddie objects, saying that he would drown himself. Everybody laughs at Mr. Frog, who then goes to hide in the watering trough.

Benjamin Bat is having trouble finding anyone who is willing to participate in the contest of hanging upside down by their heels. When he asks Kiddie Katydid, Kiddie declines. Benjamin becomes angry and threatens to eat Kiddie if he doesn't participate. Kiddie remains silent and hopes that Benjamin will go away and get a good meal before coming back.

Mr. Frog, the tailor, is trying to manage the wholeaffair and objects to every arrangement that Benjamin Bat has made. Mr. Frog and Kiddie Katydid have a conversation about jumping, with Kiddie Katydid insisting that he is not worried about Mr. Frog beating him. Kiddie Katydid then hides among the leaves, where he can listen to people and talk to them when he wants to. Kiddie Katydid is being chased by Benjamin Bat and wishes that he would just go away and get a good meal somewhere. Benjamin Bat is angry because Kiddie Katydid won't try the sport of hanging head downward by his heels.

Last chunk: water, and stay there until he was sure  that his remarks had been forgotten.  Meanwhile Benjamin Bat was worrying. He couldn't find anybody who was  willing to try the sport of hanging head downward by his heels. He asked  Kiddie Katydid; and Kiddie declined flatly to do any such thing.  Now, since Benjamin had not yet dined, he was very short-tempered. And  he grew angry at once.  "What's the matter?" he sneered. "Don't you know how to do an easy trick  like that? If I could see you--" he
