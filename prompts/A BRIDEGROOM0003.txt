Outline: Daddy Longlegs is taken by surprise when he is suddenly visited by a group of his friends, who inform him that they are going to call him by a different name - 'Grandfather Graybeard'. Daddy Longlegs is pleased with his new name, but his friends are soon interrupted by the arrival of a large lady, who is also of Daddy Longlegs' kind. The lady is not pleased with the new name, and she insists that Daddy Longlegs withdraw his consent. Poor Daddy Longlegs is forced to agree, and he follows the lady away. His friends are left confused and bewildered.

Later, little Mrs. Ladybug arrives and explains that Daddy Longlegs has a new wife. Therefore, the 'bride' would not want her husband to be known as 'Grandfather Graybeard'. With this new information, the friends of Daddy Longlegs finally understand the situation and they all go their separate ways.

Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug tells Mr. Chippy that Daddy Longlegs is a much younger person than he appears to be. Mr. Chippy is pleased with himself for coming up with the idea to give three cheers for Grandfather Graybeard, and Daddy Longlegs agrees with him.

Last chunk: Daddy Longlegs cried, as a look of  pleasure crossed his face.  "I'm glad you think so," said Mr. Chippy. "It's only fair to tell you  that I thought of it myself."  And then he called for "three cheers for Grandfather Graybeard!"  They gave them with a right good will.  And after the sound had died away Mr. Chippy said something in a whisper  to Daddy.  "What is it?" Rusty Wren demanded. "What's he talking about?"  "He thinks we ought to give three cheers for him," Daddy Longlegs  explained.
