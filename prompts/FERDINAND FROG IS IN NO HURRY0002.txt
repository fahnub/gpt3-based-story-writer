Outline: Grandaddy Beaver goes to Ferdinand Frog for help in getting the Beavers new clothes. Ferdinand agrees, but is reluctant to give away his secret. He tells Grandaddy to meet him at the big rock on the other side of the pond that night and to bring everyone who wants to know how to get new clothes. Ferdinand says that everything will be made easy if they do as he says.

Story so far:  Grandaddy Beaver asks Mr. Frog to help him get his family out of a scrape and Mr. Frog does a number of things to show that he can't do it. Mr. Frog tells Grandaddy Beaver to come to the big rock on the other side of the pond that night and to bring anyone who wants to know how to get clothes like Mr. Frog's. Frog agrees to help Grandaddy Beaver, but won't give away his secret. He winks and pokes Beaver's ribs instead. Grandaddy Beaver goes to Ferdinand Frog and tells him that he needs to help the pond folk by telling them how to make clothes that are ahead of the times. When Ferdinand Frog asks why, Grandaddy Beaver tells him that the pond folk can't work without clothes.

Last chunk: villagers, such as Grandaddy Beaver, began  to see that something would have to be done. There was the dam, which  needed mending; and there was the winter's food, which had to be  gathered.  So Grandaddy Beaver went to Ferdinand Frog one day and told him that he  simply _must_ come to the rescue of the pond folk, and tell them how  they might have clothes as far ahead of the times as were his own.  "Why?" Mr. Frog inquired. "What's the trouble?"  "They can't work," Grandaddy Beaver told him.
