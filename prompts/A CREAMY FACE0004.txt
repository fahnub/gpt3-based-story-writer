Outline: Spot the dog is on the prowl to catch the thief who has been stealing Farmer Green's cream. He soon discovers that the culprit is Miss Kitty Cat, who has been sneaking into the buttery to lap up the cream. He exposes her to Mrs. Green, who then stops up the hole that Miss Kitty has been using to access the buttery. Miss Kitty goes back to lapping up her saucer of milk, and Spot teases her about knowing who the thief was all along.

Story so far:  Spot the dog is hoping to catch the person who has been stealing cream from the kitchen. His owner, Miss Kitty Cat, is not interested in helping him and gets angry when he tries to talk to her about it. Spot thinks she is just jealous of his skills as a watchdog. The passage tells the story of Farmer Green's wife throwing away milk because she suspects that cream has been stolen from it. Old dog Spot tells Miss Kitty Cat that this is a waste, as the milk could be fed to the pigs. Miss Kitty was caught stealing milk from the buttery, so Farmer Green stopped up the stove-pipe hole to prevent her from getting back in. Miss Kitty's appetite for milk returned, and she lapped up a saucer of milk greedily. Old dog Spot watched her with a grin. When Miss Kitty Cat visited the kitchen later, there wasn't a speck of dirt on her coat and her face was spotless. Old dog Spot had a plan that pleased him hugely. The speaker boasts about catching the cream thief, but Miss Kitty replies that she knew who the thief was long before the speaker did. The cat was caught stealing cream from the shed by the dog, who alerted the owner. Miss Kitty Cat usually keeps her opinions to herself, but she boasted about catching the cream thief. Old dog Spot began to watch the buttery carefully, and he found a chink that was big enough for a mouse to squeeze through. Spot sees Miss Kitty Cat sneak into the buttery through a hole in the chimney and hide in a pile of junk.

Last chunk: something moving under the  roof of the shed next the buttery. To his amazement he saw Miss Kitty  Cat slip through an old stove-pipe hole that pierced the great chimney  which led down into the buttery, where there was an ancient fireplace  which hadn't been used for years and years. Miss Kitty Cat crept along a  tiebeam and hid herself in a pile of odds and ends that somebody had  stowed high up under the roof and left there to gather dust and  cob-webs.  "Ah, ha!" said Spot under his breath.
