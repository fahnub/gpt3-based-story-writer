Outline: Dickie Deer Mouse is looking for a new home, and has heard that Mr. Crow is moving. He goes to Mr. Crow's house to investigate, and finds the old gentleman asleep. When Dickie accidentally wakes him, Mr. Crow is startled and angry. He demands to know what Dickie is doing there, and Dickie explains that he thought Mr. Crow was moving. Mr. Crow tells him to leave, and Dickie does so. It is clear that Dickie will have to find a new home elsewhere.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow screams for help, flaps and flounders around, and Dickie Deer Mouse manages to slip away unnoticed. However, instead of running away, Dickie Deer Mouse hangs around and calls out to Mr. Crow, apologizing for disturbing him. Dickie Deer Mouse is looking for a summer home and finds Mr. Crow's house. Mr. Crow tells him that his house is too small for both of them, so Dickie Deer Mouse runs away.

Last chunk: now why you came sneaking into my house.  You'd like to live here yourself."  "Pardon me!" Dickie Deer Mouse exclaimed with the lowest of bows. "You  are mistaken, Mr. Crow. Though your house is a fine, large one, it's  much too small to hold us both."  And whisking about, while Mr. Crow stared at him, he ran down the tall  elm as fast as he could go.  It was clear that if Mr. Crow wasn't going to move he would have to look  elsewhere for a summer home.  [Illustration]      [Illustration]
