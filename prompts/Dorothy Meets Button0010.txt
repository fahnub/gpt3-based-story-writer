Story so far: The passage describes the meeting of three characters - the Ork, the Bumpy Man, and Button-Bright. The Ork reflects on the question and says that he could carry one of the children on his back, but three adults would be too much. He suggests that they made a mistake in eating the purple berries so soon. The Bumpy Man shovels snow and finds someone buried in it. The shaggy man decides to call the boy Button-Bright, after his mother does. Button-Bright is curious about the Ork's tail, and asks to see how it works. The Ork explains that it is his tail and he reserves the right to whirl it himself. Button-Bright then proposes they go out and fly somewhere so he can see how the tail works. The Ork declines, saying he only flies when he is going somewhere. Button-Bright is digging a hole when the shaggy man comes along and tells him that he should come with them. Toto, who has been watching the boy dig, becomes excited and starts barking.

The little dog  began barking loudly and jumped into the hole
