Outline: A group of animals are racing to Moscow before the close of day. The first to leave is a butterfly riding on a frog. Next is a water rat floating on a log, followed by a caterpillar on the fence and a hopper in the hay. The animals all race as fast as they can, but it's unclear who will make it to Moscow first.

Story so far: The passage describes how a crow boasted that it could fly faster than a train, but was later outpaced by Brer Rabbit in a race. The other animals became angry and chased Brer Rabbit, but he was able to clean himself off while they were still covered in mud. Mr. Crow then challenged the Rainmaker to a race, which he won. A man comes down the road, coughing and sneezing. He affects all the animals, who all start coughing and sneezing too. Brer Dust nearly buries Brer Bear. A cloud crops up and Uncle Win and Cousin Rain get out. The race begins and Uncle Win blows his bellows. This is a children's poem about a race to Moscow. Various animals are racing each other to see who can get there first. Brer Rabbit went to the Rainmaker's house and asked him to arrange a race between Brer Dust and Cousin Rain. Mr. Crow races a train and beats it, then flies in front of it, causing it to make a noise and stop. Brer Rabbit and the other animals are waiting for something to happen. Brer B'ar is growling, Brer Wolf is howling, and Brer Possum is laughing. Then a cloud comes up, and Brer Rabbit knows that Cousin Rain is coming. Brer Rabbit is very fast and can outrun any other creature.
