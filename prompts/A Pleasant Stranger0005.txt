Outline: Master Meadow Mouse enjoys swimming and likes to live near water, so he and his family make their home in the low meadow near Broad Brook and Black Creek. Master Meadow Mouse is taught how to swim by his mother and quickly becomes proficient at it.

One day, Master Meadow Mouse meets Ferdinand Frog, a greenish gentleman with a wide smile and bulging eyes. Ferdinand Frog tells Master Meadow Mouse about the Pickerel tribe, the most dangerous fish in the creek, and warns him to be careful.

Mrs. Meadow Mouse is worried when her son tells her about his meeting with Ferdinand Frog and warns him to stay away from the slippery villain. She is even more worried when Master Meadow Mouse says that Ferdinand Frog promised to teach him to dive.

Fortunately, Master Meadow Mouse has enough sense to stay on the bank when he sees the Pickerel family swimming around the bend in the creek. He knows that it would be dangerous to swim with them.

In the end, Mrs. Meadow Mouse is relieved that her son is safe and has learned a valuable lesson about listening to his elders.

Story so far:  Mrs. Meadow Mouse and her son are discussing the dangers of swimming with a great big mouthy fish. Master Meadow Mouse says the fish is a great swimmer and promised to teach him to dive, but Mrs. Meadow Mouse is glad he had the sense to stay on the bank.

Last chunk: enough," Mrs. Meadow Mouse agreed. "He'd grin and  swallow you at the same time with that great mouth of his. That's what  makes him so dangerous."  "Well, he's a fine swimmer, anyhow," her son declared.  "Another reason why you should avoid him!" his mother retorted.  "You ought to see him dive," said Master Meadow Mouse. "He promised to  teach me to dive if I'd join him in the water."  "It's a mercy you didn't,". Mrs. Meadow Mouse gasped. "I'm glad you had  sense enough to stay on the bank."
