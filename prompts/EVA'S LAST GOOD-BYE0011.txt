Outline: Eva is a young girl who is very ill. Her uncle, Tom, is a slave who loves her very much and takes care of her. Eva knows she is going to die soon and she makes her uncle promise to free him when she dies.

A few nights later, Eva dies in her sleep. True to his promise, Mr. St. Clare goes to his lawyer to start the process of freeing Tom. He tells Tom to pack his things and get ready to go home.

While Tom is waiting for Mr. St. Clare to come home from a ride, he falls asleep on the verandah. He is awakened by a loud knock at the gate and he runs to open it. It is Mr. St. Clare, who has been in an accident and is dying.

Tom stays with Mr. St. Clare until he dies, and then he goes home to his wife and children as a free man.

Story so far:  Eva is very ill and everyone tries to make her comfortable. Tom expresses his preference for having his own poor belongings over having the best belongings that belong to someone else. St. Clare comments that he doesn't understand why Tom feels this way, but accepts it. In the passage, Mr. St. Clare is asked whose slave Topsy is, to which he replies that she is the slave of whoever purchased her. The person asking then says that they would like Mr. St. Clare to give them a paper stating that Topsy is theirs, to which Mr. St. Clare agrees. Mr. St. Clare had been in an accident and was dying.

Last chunk: his master came home. While he waited, he fell asleep.  Presently he was awakened by loud knocking, and the sound of voices at the gate.  He ran to open it.  Several men were there carrying a load. It was Mr. St. Clare. He had been hurt in an accident, and was dying.  Very gently they laid him on a sofa. Nothing could be done. In a short time he had gone to join his little Eva.
