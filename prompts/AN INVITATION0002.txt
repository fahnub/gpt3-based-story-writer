Outline: Rusty Wren's cousin, Long Bill, is having a party tomorrow at his home near Black Creek and has sent old Mr. Crow to deliver the invitation. When Jolly Robin arrives with the message, Rusty is excited to attend but his wife is not pleased as it is a men's party. Rusty promises to help his wife with her house-cleaning tomorrow but is clearly eager to attend the party. His wife warns him that he will be busy at home. The next day, Rusty goes to the party while his wife stays home to clean.

Last chunk: that Rusty met this cousin of his, for Rusty  seldom ventured so far from home as Black Creek. And being very  fond of water, Long Bill did not care to spend any of his valuable  time in Farmer Green's dooryard.  Of course, there was the duck pond not far away--and the river,  too. But the only water really close to Rusty's home was the  watering-trough. And that was entirely too small to please Long  Bill Wren. So no one ever saw him around the farm buildings.  For a long time Rusty had neither
