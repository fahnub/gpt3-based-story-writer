Outline: Grunty Pig insists that his tail is the most beautiful in the neighborhood, but old dog Spot points out that it would be more convenient if it were nailed to the outside of the barn. Grunty Pig is reluctant to part with his tail, but Spot persuades him to see how tailless pigs look. Grunty Pig squeezes through a hole in the fence to follow Spot, but gets stuck. Spot nips him and he falls through to the other side. Spot leads him to a group of tailless pigs and Grunty Pig is horrified. He runs back home and Farmer Green cuts off his tail and nails it to the barn.

Story so far: Grunty Pig is considering cutting off his tail, but he is unsure if it would be beneficial. He asks old dog Spot for advice, and Spot tells him that he has seen many happy pigs without tails. Grunty Pig is interested to see them and decides to go ahead with cutting off his tail. Miss Kitty washes her face and then takes a nap. The passage describes a pig and a dog who are excited to be outside the yard. The pig says "Umph! Umph!" and the dog is not quite sure what it means.

Last chunk: frantic  plunge forward and fell, sprawling, on the ground outside the yard,  where Spot soon joined him.  "It takes old Spot to hurry 'em along," said the old dog gleefully.  Grunty Pig said "Umph! Umph!"  Old dog Spot was not quite sure what he meant.
