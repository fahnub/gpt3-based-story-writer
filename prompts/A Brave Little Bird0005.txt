Outline: Frisky Squirrel is being chased by Mr. and Mrs. Hawk, and is getting tired and scared. He calls for his mother, but she is not home. He tries to make a run for his home in a hickory tree, but the hawks won't let him. Suddenly, Mr. Kinglet, a small olive-green bird, comes to his rescue, pecking Mr. Hawk on the back and driving the hawks away. Frisky Squirrel make it safely home, and the forest-people all thank Mr. and Mrs. Kinglet. Frisky Squirrel is ashamed of how he has teased Mrs. Kinglet in the past, and promises to never bother her again.

Story so far:  Mr. and Mrs. Kinglet drove away the animals that were bothering Frisky Squirrel. Frisky Squirrel thanked them and promised not to bother them again. Mr. Kinglet sees Mr. Hawk trying to catch Frisky the wren, so he flies up to Mr. Hawk and pecks him with his sharp bill.

Last chunk: little frightened wren screamed, Mr. Kinglet made up his mind  that it was time for him to do something. And he pushed his red crown  up on the top of his head where it would show better and he flew  straight toward Mr. Hawk.  Mr. Kinglet flew up over Mr. Hawk's head, and then he darted down and  lighted right in the middle of Mr. Hawk's broad back, and began  pecking him as hard as he could with his sharp little bill.  Mr. Hawk stopped trying to catch Frisky. He had all he wanted to do to
