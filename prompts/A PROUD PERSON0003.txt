Outline: Turkey Proudfoot meets the new peacock on the farm and is immediately intimidated by him. The peacock is much larger than Turkey and has a beautiful, full tail. Turkey tries to talk to the peacock, but he is met with silence. Henrietta Hen tells Turkey that the peacock is likely dumb and Turkey should be polite to him. The peacock then screams, startling both Turkey and Henrietta. They both understand that the peacock is not dumb, but his voice is so terrible that they can't understand what he's saying. The peacock tells Turkey that he is not a barnyard fowl and doesn't belong with the other farm animals. Turkey is hurt and angry by this, but he doesn't dare confront the peacock because he is so big and scary. The peacock walks away and Turkey is left feeling humiliated.

Story so far:  The peacock asked Turkey Proudfoot if he was a barnyard fowl, and when Turkey said yes, the peacock told him he wasn't. The peacock tells Turkey Proudfoot that he will probably not see much of each other, and then walks away. This upsets Turkey Proudfoot, who is tempted to attack the peacock, but decides against it because the peacock looks so big and strong. The peacock made a loud noise, startling Turkey Proudfoot and Henrietta Hen. A peacock is strutting around the lawn, showing off its tail with its many eyes. Turkey Proudfoot tries to stare it down, but eventually gives up. Turkey Proudfoot is mad that the peacock is ignoring him. Turkey Proudfoot is frightened by a loud, harsh voice coming from atop a wall, and does not dare to threaten the speaker. Turkey Proudfoot is talking to the newcomer, who has not spoken since arriving an hour ago. Henretta Hen interrupts and says that they have decided he is dumb, and it's a pity if he is because his voice would probably be as beautiful as his tail.

Last chunk: "Maybe I'm  not enough of a dandy--"  Just then somebody interrupted him. It was Henrietta Hen. Being a prying  sort of person she had followed Turkey Proudfoot around the house to see  what happened when he and the newcomer met.  "Don't be rude to this gentleman," said Henrietta Hen. "He hasn't  spoken since he arrived in the wagon an hour ago. We've about decided  that he is dumb. And it's a great pity if he is. No doubt his voice--if  he had one--would be as beautiful as his tail."  At that
