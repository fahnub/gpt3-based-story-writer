Story so far: The passage describes the speaker's thoughts on her relatives and the family's history with an apple orchard. The orchard was started by the family's grandfather 60 years ago and is still remembered by them today. The girl with the wonderful voice said that she knows stories about the orchard, as they walk across the yard followed by Paddy. The passage describes the beauty of a morning landscape including a valley, hill, and grove of trees. There is a rare breeze and the shadows are long and clear. The speaker does not understand why everything is settled for people before they are born. The person they are speaking to says that grown-ups often say things that are hard to understand. The speaker then asks what Uncle Roger is like and is told that he is big and jolly but teases people too much. Sara's conscience is always troubling her for doing things she's sure her mother won't approve, but it only spoils her fun. Uncle Roger says that a mother who won't let you do anything, and a conscience that won't let you enjoy anything is an awful combination. But the real reason Sara is pale and thin and nervous is that her mother doesn't give her enough to eat. This passage describes how every tree in an orchard was planted by someone in the family, and each tree was known by the name of the person it was planted for. The passage describes how the speaker is no longer scared of Sara Ray, but still would not want to be caught by her. Peter Craig says she is a witch, but the speaker does not believe this.

Last chunk: not so frightened of her as I once was, but  I don't think I would like to be caught by her. Sara Ray is dreadfully  scared of her. Peter Craig says she is a witch and that he bets she's at  the bottom of it when the butter won't come. But I don't believe THAT.  Witches are so scarce nowadays. There may be some somewhere in the  world, but it's not likely there are any here right in Prince Edward  Island. They used to be very plenty long ago. I know some splendid witch  stories I'll tell you
