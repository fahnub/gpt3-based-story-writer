Outline: Seven friends are digging for treasure in the garden when they suddenly fall into a hidden tunnel. One of the boys, Albert, is buried under the rubble. The others frantically dig him out and he is unharmed but upset. They all share the two half-crowns they find as treasure.

Story so far:  This passage tells us that the best part of books (and real life) is when things are happening, not when people are just talking. The author says they won't bore us with all the days when nothing happened, because that would be pointless. Alice and Dora discuss the meaning of "moral force", which is the ability to influence others through methods such as shaming, mockery, or bribery. Albert-next-door's uncle interrupts and asks them to explain what happened to Albert. Dora says that she is sorry it happened to him, and that she would have preferred it if it had happened to someone else. The speaker was supposed to go into the tunnel to dig for treasure, but they didn't because they don't like worms. They were just about to reach the underground passage to the secret hoard when the tunnel fell in on Albert. Two children are digging for treasure in their backyard, when their neighbor Albert comes over. He is uninterested in their treasure hunt, and only laughs at them. The passage is about a group of children trying to help their neighbor, Albert, dig for buried treasure. They encourage him to keep going even when he gets tired, and remind him that thinking of other people's comfort makes them like you. The passage describes two children who are digging for treasure in their garden. They find a spot where the ground is softer and start digging. They get hot, but don't find anything. Albert-next-door comes over and they let him play with them.

Last chunk: very hard.  So we thought we'd try another part of the garden, and we found a  place in the big round flower bed, where the ground was much softer. We  thought we'd make a smaller hole to begin with, and it was much better.  We dug and dug and dug, and it was jolly hard work! We got very hot  digging, but we found nothing.  Presently Albert-next-door looked over the wall. We do not like him very  much, but we let him play with us sometimes, because his father is dead,  and you must not be unkind
