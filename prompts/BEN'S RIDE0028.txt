Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

The passage describes a situation where a person has gone missing, and the person's horse seems to be searching for them. The horse's owner says that the person was foolish to try and cross the area where they disappeared, and calls out for them, but there is no answer.

"You were a fool to try there; but where is Miss Celia?" said Ben, who  talked to animals as if they were people, and was understood much better  than any one not used to their companionship would imagine.  Now Lita seemed at a loss, and put her head down, as if she expected to  find her mistress where she had left her, somewhere on the ground. Ben  called, but there was no answer; and he rode slowly along the
