Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

Story so far:  The Queen asks if the children think she's beautiful, and they all say no. The Scoodler hurls the head of the shaggy man's head at the Rainbow's Daughter, but the shaggy man catches it and puts it in a sack. The body of the guard runs around aimlessly, and the shaggy man easily dodges it and opens the door to the big cave. The passage describes the characters' relief at leaving the cave and getting back onto the familiar path. The shaggy man stands outside the opening to the black gulf and catches the heads of the Scoodlers as they try to escape. He throws them back into the gulf. The Scoodlers are planning to make soup out of the captives, adding salt, onions, garlic, and red pepper to the broth. The speaker, a Scoodler, is telling the children that they will be made into soup if they don't escape. Polychrome is the only one who is not sitting sadly with the other captives. The passage describes the shaggy man's assurance to Button-Bright that they are now safe from the Scoodlers, as the Scoodlers will be unable to eat.

Last chunk: was young," he remarked,  "for I caught all those heads easily and never missed one.  But come  along, little ones; the Scoodlers will never bother us or anyone else  any more."  Button-Bright was still frightened and kept insisting, "I don't want to  be soup!" for the victory had been gained so suddenly that the boy  could not realize they were free and safe.  But the shaggy man assured  him that all danger of their being made into soup was now past, as the  Scoodlers would be unable to eat
