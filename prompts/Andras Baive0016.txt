Outline: Andras Baive is a strong and swift Laplander who lives in Vadso. The people of Vadso are very proud of their champion, and think that he is the best runner in the world. However, they soon hear of another Laplander, Andras Baive, who is said to be even stronger and faster than their own champion.

The bailiff of Vadso challenges Andras to a race, with the stipulation that whoever can jump over an eight-oared boat without touching it with their heel will be the winner. Andras easily wins the race, much to the dismay of the bailiff.

The bailiff decides to get revenge on Andras by challenging him to a race across a fiord. However, Andras is able to use his magic powers to transform himself into a reindeer and easily outrun the bailiff.

The bailiff, who is really a Stalo (ogre), is mortally wounded in the race and asks Andras to promise to give him an honourable burial. Andras agrees, and also agrees to take anything he finds in the bailiff's house.

Andras sails across the fiord in the bailiff's boat and finds the bailiff's dog and son. He kills the dog, as it is known that if a Stalo's dog licks the blood of his dead master, the Stalo will come back to life. Andras takes the bailiff's treasure and gives it to his son before returning home.

He marries a rich wife and they live happily ever after.

Story so far: Two men in Vadso are competing in a jumping contest. Andras wins, but the bailiff is not happy about it. Andras spends many hours studying magic, and this helps him when he needs to escape from the Stalo music. He turns into a reindeer and gallops for several miles, then stops to listen for the Stalo music. It is getting closer, so he runs again. The protagonist, fleeing from an unknown fear, hears the sound of a pipe and realizes that the bailiff from earlier is behind him. The Stalo is mortally wounded, and asks Andras to give him an honorable burial and take whatever he finds in his house that belongs to him. He also asks Andras to kill his dog, but spare his son. Andras draws his bow and arrows and takes aim at the Stalo, but the Stalo jumps so high that the arrows miss. Andras finally hits the Stalo with his third arrow. The passage tells the story of a boy who kills a Stalo's dog, which causes the Stalo to come back to life. Andras then puts all the gold and jewels he finds in the boat into his pockets and tells the boy to get in.

Last chunk: boy.The dog, a fierce, wicked-looking creature, heslew with one blow from his fist, for it is well known that if aStalo's dog licks the blood that flows from his dead master's woundsthe Stalo comes to life again.That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seenwithout his dog; but the bailiff, being only half a Stalo, hadforgotten him, when he went to the little lakes in search of Andras.Next, Andras put all the gold and jewels which he found in the boatinto his pockets, and bidding the boy get in, pushed
