Outline: Trot is dreaming that she is at home in her bed, but she is cold and unable to move. She realizes that she is frozen inside of a block of ice and wakes up. She sees that the mermaid queen, Aquareine, is also frozen and realizes that their enemy, Zog, has frozen them while they slept. Trot decides that the only way to escape is to wait for the queen to melt the ice around them. The queen does so and they are able to swim to Cap'n Bill's room. They find that he is almost frozen and they have to rub him to bring him back to life. The queen and Clia decide that they need to leave the castle and they swim for the opening in the dome. They are followed by scores of sea devils, but they are able to make it through the opening and escape.

Story so far: Captain Bill and Trot are talking to the Queen and Princess Clia about the Arctic. The Queen and Princess Clia tell them that they can stay in the palace. Trot decides to leave the castle to find a way to help Captain Bill and the Queen. The Queen uses her magic power to melt the ice, and Trot and Clia rub Cap'n Bill's hands, nose, and ears to warm him up. After breaking a hole in a glass dome with a sword, a group of people swim through the opening and find themselves in an underwater castle. The Queen of the mermaids tells Trot that they will try to escape their captors, and that she is willing to risk everything for their safety. Trot is courageous and tells the Queen that she is ready to face whatever comes.

Last chunk: devils. The mermaid queen had  determined to attack this monster. If she succeeded in destroying it  with her golden sword, the little band of fugitives might then swim  through the opening into the clear waters of the ocean. Although  this prince of the sea devils was said to be big and wise and  mighty, there was but one of him to fight; whereas, if they  attempted to escape through any of the passages, they must encounter  scores of such enemies.  "Swim straight for the opening in the dome!"
