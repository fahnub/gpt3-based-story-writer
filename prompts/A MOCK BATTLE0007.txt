Outline: Nimble, a young deer, is excited to have finally grown antlers with three points on each. This summer, his fourth, he is now considered a "three-pointer." He aspires to have five-point antlers like his father, and begins practicing mock battles with his friend Dodger. Dodger is quick and agile, often dodging Nimble's attacks at the last second.

One day, they are practicing their mock battles when Nimble's mother interrupts them, scolding them and warning them that someone could get hurt. They pay little heed to her warning and continue practicing when they are suddenly joined by old Mr. Crow. Mr. Crow encourages them to keep going, and they become more aggressive in their mock battle.

At one point, Dodger and Nimble clash in the air and fall to the ground. Mr. Crow is pleased with this more aggressive mock battle, but Nimble and Dodger have both been hurt in the fall. They are quickly scolded by Nimble's mother and told to never mock battle again.

Last chunk: stand and _wait_ for the enemy."  Of course Dodger couldn't help wanting to show Mr. Crow that he knew how  to carry on a mock battle. So the next time Nimble rushed at him Dodger  did not wait. He jumped to meet Nimble. They struck in the air with a  frightful crash and fell sprawling upon the ground.  "Ha! That's more like it!" Mr. Crow applauded. "That's the sort of mock  battle I like to see!"
