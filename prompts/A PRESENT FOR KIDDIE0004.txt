Outline: Mr. Frog brings a present for Kiddie Katydid - an overcoat - all the way from the creek. Kiddie is pleased, but a little bit anxious, as he only wears green. Mr. Frog assures him that the overcoat is green and hangs it on a twig for Kiddie to try on later. He then goes back to the watering trough to wet his feet. When he comes back, Kiddie has already tried on the overcoat and loves it.

Story so far: Mr. Frog makes an overcoat for Kiddie Katydid and delivers it to her. Kiddie is pleased with the gift and grateful to Mr. Frog. Mr. Frog tells Kiddie that he will go hang the coat up and wet his feet, and while he is gone, she can try the coat on. Kiddie is anxious that the coat is green, because that is her favorite color.

He notices that it's not as cold in Farmer Green's dooryard as it was by the creek, so he stops to cool himself in the watering-trough. Then he hops briskly on to the front yard.

And by the time  Mr. Frog had reached his journey's end he was almost overheated.  Besides, as he noticed, it was not so cold in Farmer Green's dooryard as  it had been by the creek.  He stopped, for a few moments, to cool himself in the watering-trough.  And then he hopped briskly on to the front yard.  To his great delight he had scarcely reached the
