Outline: Snowball, a sheep, is knocked down by a black ram and decides he must be sheared. He goes to the pasture to find his old companions, but they are so changed by shearing that he can't tell who is who. He grins at them, and the big old dame scolds him, telling him he will be sheared too. Farmer Green comes in and Johnnie Green says he wants to shear Snowball himself. They go to the barn, but Johnnie decides to go fishing instead and Snowball is left un-sheared. The next morning, Johnnie comes back and corrals Snowball, leading him to the barn to be sheared. The black ram and the other sheep wait at the pasture bars for Snowball to return, but he comes back without his fleece.

Story so far:  Snowball sees his old companions, but they are so changed by shearing that he doesn't recognize them. He stands and grins at them. Snowball is worried that he will be sheared, but Aunt Nancy reassures him that he will have a chance to laugh at himself later. Johnnie Green doesn't want his father to shear Snowball, because he wants to do it himself.

Last chunk: run, Johnnie Green came  hurrying after his father, and shouting.  "Don't touch Snowball!" he called. "Don't you shear him!"  "Why not?" his father asked him.  "Because," said Johnnie, "I want to shear him myself. He belongs to me."  "Very well!" his father replied. "Now we're here we may as well catch  him. And you can begin shearing him. It will probably take you all day,  because you've never sheared a sheep before."  "I don't want to shear him now," said Johnnie. "I'm going fishing  to-day.
