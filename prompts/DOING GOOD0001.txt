Story so far:  A woman is asked how she would feel if she found a lot of money, and she says that it would be nice but that it is just a legend. The legend is that one of her ancestors hid a treasure a long time ago. The children in the passage found a treasure and told the lady about it. The lady was very happy and the children helped her to get the treasure. The lady closes the door and says she hasn't heard an English voice in a long time. The boys are embarrassed because the floors are so clean. There is a small, bright fire in the room. The Phoenix speaks excellent French and tells the lady that it is also fluent in English. The children are surprised and horrified that the Phoenix would ask the lady why she is sad near Christmas time. Robert and Jane are discussing what to do with the bones they find in the castle. Robert suggests taking them to the nearest town and giving them to the sorrowing friends of the deceased. Jane objects, saying that they should just leave the bones where they are. The passage describes the children sneaking away while the lady and priest are distracted. The guardian angels then take the children home on a carpet. Little Henri sees them disappear. The passage describes the children's reaction to their mother's letter telling them they are going to their aunt's for Christmas. Jane is unexpectedly happy about the news, while Robert and Cyril are more skeptical.
