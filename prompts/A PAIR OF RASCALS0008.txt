Outline: Mr. Frog is a tailor who lives by a creek. One day, he sees Mr. Crow flying overhead and calls out to him. Mr. Crow is on his way to the cornfield and doesn't want to stop, but Mr. Frog insists that he has important news.

Mr. Frog tells Mr. Crow that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler and that's how he makes his famous "Katy did, Katy" song. Mr. Crow is unimpressed and tells Mr. Frog that he won't be spreading this news around.

Mr. Frog is disappointed but Mr. Crow is unmoved. He tells Mr. Frog that he's not going to tell Brownie Beaver about the news either, because they've had a disagreement. Mr. Crow flies off to the cornfield and Mr. Frog is left alone.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow is wise and knows that Mr. Frog is not to be trusted. He decides to spread news about Pleasant Valley in his own way, without thanking Mr. Frog. Mr. Frog is disappointed but does not blame himself. The narrator's grandfather told him a secret, but only after he had eaten breakfast. The grandfather may have been in a better mood if the secret had been shared earlier.

Last chunk: the  secret till after the old boy had his breakfast. Then perhaps he'd have  been better natured."
