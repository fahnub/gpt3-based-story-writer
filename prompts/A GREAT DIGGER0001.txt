Outline: This is a playful poem about a child who is eager to eat their meal. The child is excited about the food they are going to have and the prospect of eating it. The poem speaks to the child's innocence and their joy in the simple things in life.

Story so far: The passage describes animals with various personality traits. Grunty Pig's mother tells him to restrain himself when eating, as there is always enough food for everyone. Henrietta Hen is a popular hen who enjoys the attention she gets from her neighbors. She goes out of her way to be seen by as many people as possible. Brer Rabbit is hosting a race on a hot summer day. A storm blows in, and the child who was playing nearby runs to take shelter with Uncle Remus. Mrs. Jolly Robin is upset because her husband is not helping her catch food for their family. She tells him he will have to spend all his time catching angleworms, and he is glad to do it. Mrs. Robin manages to feed her children and the young Cowbird in her nest. The passage describes how Brer Rabbit got covered in mud while being chased by Brer Dust, but was able to clean himself off while the other animals were still covered in mud. This made the other animals mad, and they all went after Brer Rabbit. Grandfather Mole was an expert at finding angleworms. He had the advantage of being able to prowl his galleries and find the angleworms right where they lived. Mr. Frog is expecting callers and has gone out to watch for them. He is excited because his ideas about the weather have been proved to be good. Brer Rabbit and the Rainmaker agree to have a race, with the Rainmaker only agreeing because Brer Rabbit is the challenger. Brer Rabbit tells all the other animals about the race, and on the day of the race, the two competitors start in the middle of the big road. Benny Badger lives on the high, dry plains where he has plenty of ground squirrels and prairie dogs for neighbors. The little wild people wish Benny Badger was somewhere else, but he doesn't care.
