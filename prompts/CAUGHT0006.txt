Outline: Johnnie Green sees Mr. Turtle and chases after him. He catches up to Mr. Turtle and traps him with a stick. Johnnie Green is unsure of what to do with Mr. Turtle, but he eventually decides to flip him over on his back. Johnnie Green leaves Mr. Turtle there, unable to move. Mr. Crow arrives and hears Timothy's remarks.

Story so far: Mr. Crow is angry with Farmer Green for placing a giant in the cornfield, but he discovers that it is just a straw scarecrow. Henrietta Hen is accused of being a thief, but Mr. Crow is angry because Henrietta won't speak. Peppery Polly's people, Freddie Firefly, grew discouraged but decided to go to the dance. The passage describes two people who are surprised and begin to shake, but only one of them is actually laughing. Old Mr. Crow arrives to find Timothy in a frightening and angry position, and Timothy proceeds to tell him what he thinks about boys and Johnnie Green.

Last chunk: his legs, and twisted his neck about.  But all his wiggling and twisting were of not the slightest help to him.  It was the first time in his long life that he had ever found himself in  that position on land. And he was both frightened and angry.  Old Mr. Crow, who had a way of knowing when there was anything unusual  going on, arrived in time to hear Timothy's remarks. And what he said  about boys--and especially about Johnnie Green--made Mr. Crow catch his  breath.
