Outline: Rusty Wren's wife is still shaken up after being frightened by Jasper Jay dropping cherries on her house. Rusty takes it upon himself to find food for their six children, and he works tirelessly to do so. However, as the children grow, they need more and more food, and Rusty realizes he won't be able to keep up. He comes up with the idea to get somebody to help him, and his wife reluctantly agrees. Rusty hangs a sign that says "Boy Wanted" and soon enough, a young bird named Freddy Finch comes along and applies for the job. Freddy is a hard worker and a quick learner, and Rusty's wife soon warms up to him. The family is doing well until one day, Freddy doesn't come home from work. Rusty and his wife worry all night, and the next day they set out to find Freddy. They eventually find him lying on the ground, sick and injured. They take him back to their home and nurse him back to health, and Freddy is soon part of the family for good.

Story so far:  Rusty's wife does not want to stay alone in the house at night with six small children, so Rusty plans to get somebody to help him. The passage describes a man who is growing thin and his wife who is worried about their children's future. Rusty Wren's wife is still shaken after Jasper Jay dropped cherries on their roof, and Rusty realizes she needs a break. Rusty Wren agrees to find food for his six hungry children while his wife rests, even though he knows it will be a difficult task. Rusty Wren was always busy bringing food home to his family, and now they were half starved. Mrs. Rusty does not want a stranger in her home, but her husband convinces her to try it out.

Last chunk: she objected. "And you know yourself that you've always felt the  same way about strangers."  "I know----" he replied--"but this is different. I'll find a brisk  young fellow somewhere. And after a day or two you won't mind his  being here. He'll seem just like one of the family."  It took a good deal of urging before Mrs. Rusty consented. But at  last she said she was willing to give the plan a trial, though she  felt sure it was bound to cause trouble, somehow.  So that is how Rusty Wren came
