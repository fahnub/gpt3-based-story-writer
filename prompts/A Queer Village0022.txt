Outline: Dorothy, the shaggy man, Toto, and Button-Bright are taken prisoner by foxes and led to the royal palace. The fox king questions them and is pleased to learn they are friends. The king tells Dorothy that everyone knows who she is and that she is an important personage since Princess Ozma of Oz made her her friend.
