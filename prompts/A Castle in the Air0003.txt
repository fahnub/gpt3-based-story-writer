Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is always on the move, and the latest place he decides to call home is in the cornfield. He is pleasantly surprised to find that many of his cousins have had the same idea, and there are plenty of shocks of corn for everyone to choose from.

Master Meadow Mouse settles into a huge shock of corn near the bank of Broad Brook and makes himself a nest of dry husks. He is content with his new home, and happy to have plenty of food stored away for when he gets hungry.

Master Meadow Mouse moves to the cornfield and enjoys the ripe ears of corn in the shocks. Master Meadow Mouse is pleased to see that Farmer Green has planted corn, as it will provide good homes for their family.

He changed his opinion of Farmer Green.  Master Meadow Mouse had been much upset when Farmer Green cut the grass  in the meadow at haying time. All the birds in the air could see him  whenever he crossed the bare field. Now, however, he forgot his  displeasure in the joy that Farmer Green's latest move gave him.
