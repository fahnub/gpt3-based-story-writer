Story so far:  This passage describes a child's love of drawing on slates, and how peppermint can help with arithmetic. Sam Redfern, a bush ranger, is in hiding with Annie when Jim Carlton, a detective, arrives. Sam attacks Jim, and Annie screams. (The story is to be continued.)

Last chunk: Just then Annie gave a piercing scream, and Sam Redfern got up, seizing  his revolver. 'Who are you?' he cried, as a man entered.  'I am Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective,' said the new arrival.  Sam Redfern's revolver dropped from his nerveless fingers, but the next  moment he had sprung upon the detective with the well-known activity of  the mountain sheep, and Annie shrieked, for she had grown to love the  rough Bushranger.  (To be continued at the end of the paper if there is room.)
