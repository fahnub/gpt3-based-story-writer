Outline: Dorothy and her companions are traveling through a rocky, barren landscape when they are suddenly confronted by a group of strange creatures. These creatures, known as Scoodlers, are black on one side and white on the other, with two faces on either side of their head. They are also very thin, with long fingers and toes.

The Scoodlers tell the group that they want to make them into soup, and begin to advance on them menacingly. The shaggy man tries to reason with them, but they will not listen. He then picks up a stone and throws it at them, which only seems to anger them further.

Two of the Scoodlers pick up their heads and hurl them at the shaggy man, knocking him to the ground. They then pick up their heads and put them back on their shoulders before returning to their perches on the rocks.

Dorothy and the others are now surrounded by the Scoodlers, who are blocking the path ahead of them. The shaggy man gets up and dusts himself off, and they all begin to back away slowly. The Scoodlers follow them, still threatening to make them into soup, but eventually they lose interest and turn back.

Dorothy and her companions are relieved, but Button-Bright is still upset and wants to know why the Scoodlers wanted to make them into soup. The shaggy man explains that it is probably because they are made of different materials than the Scoodlers, and that they probably think that they would make a tasty soup.

With the Scoodlers now gone, the group is able to continue on their journey. They eventually come to a fork in the road, and must decide which way to go.

Story so far:  Two animals put their heads back on after running and leaping, then returned to their original positions. The shaggy man tries to calm the Scoodlers by telling them that he loves them, and they respond by saying that they love him in soup. The passage describes the road the four companions are on to the Emerald City. The shaggy man has two apples which he divides into four pieces and gives to each of his companions. The Rainbow's Daughter asks if this is the right road to the Emerald City and Dorothy replies that she does not know but it is the only road in this direction. The country the travelers are passing through becomes increasingly rocky and difficult to walk through, and Polychrome ceases her dancing because she is now warm enough. Dorothy and the others are discussing what to do if the country ends. Dorothy says that if she had her magic belt, it could help them out. The passage describes a creature with two faces that is sitting motionless. The shaggy man says that he once had a toy that was similar, made of wood and operated with strings. Dorothy wonders if this creature also works with strings. The Scoodlers are a race of creatures who are black on one side and white on the other. They eat people, and they want to eat the shaggy man, Dorothy, and Button-Bright. But the three of them escape.

Last chunk: and they  all flopped around, so they were white, and then all flopped back  again, so they were black.  "But what do you want us for?" asked the shaggy man, uneasily.  "Soup!" they all shouted, as if with one voice.  "Goodness me!" said Dorothy, trembling a little; "the Scoodlers must be  reg'lar cannibals."  "Don't want to be soup," protested Button-Bright, beginning to cry.  "Hush, dear," said the little girl, trying to comfort him; "we don't  any of us want to be soup.  But don't worry; the
