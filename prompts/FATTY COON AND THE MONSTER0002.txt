Outline: One night, Fatty Coon is strolling along the road when he is almost caught by a monster. The monster is fast and Fatty is only able to escape by jumping to the side of the road. The monster then runs away up the hill.

Fatty Coon hurries home to tell his mother about his escape. His mother is excited and they both climb to the top of a poplar tree to see the monster. The monster is at Farmer Green's house and after a short conversation with Farmer Green, the monster drives away.

Fatty and his mother watch the monster as it drives down the valley and then they know it is gone. Fatty asks his mother if the monster ate Farmer Green and his family and she says she hopes so.

Story so far:  The creature's scary screech made Fatty jump to the side of the road, just in time. The creature then ran up the hill, so fast that it seemed to be panting. Fatty Coon is walking home from the orchard, where he ate his fill of apples. He takes his time, enjoying the quiet night. Suddenly, he is confronted by a monster. A mother and her child watch as a monster dashes down the valley. The child is frightened and asks if the monster ate up Farmer Green and his family. The mother hopes so, as it would mean fewer traps in the woods. A stranger drives up to Farmer Green's house and asks for directions to the nearest village. Fatty Coon narrowly escapes a monster, and later tells his mother about it. Mrs. Coon becomes excited, as she has heard the same strange cry that Fatty heard. They both climb to the top of an old poplar tree to look for the monster. Fatty was almost caught by a monster. He should have heard the monster coming, but he was feeling sleepy from eating too many apples. When he finally heard the monster, it was too late.

Last chunk: terrible monster almost caught him.  This is how it all happened. There was a br-br-br-r-r-r in the air.  Fatty really should have heard it long before he did. But he had eaten  so many apples that he had begun to feel sleepy; and his ears were not  so sharp as they should have been. And when at last Fatty heard that  br-r-r-r it was quite loud. He was startled. And he stopped right in the  middle of the road to listen. Fatty had never heard such a sound before.  The strange animal was on him
