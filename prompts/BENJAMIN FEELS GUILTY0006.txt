Outline: Benjamin Bat and Freddie Firefly face each other in Farmer Green's dark dooryard. Benjamin Bat tells Freddie Firefly not to bring Solomon Owl to his tree during the day, as he could be eaten. Freddie Firefly retorts that Benjamin Bat would be just as happy to be eaten by Solomon Owl as Freddie Firefly would be to be eaten by Benjamin Bat. This makes Benjamin Bat very sheepish, and Freddie Firefly knows that he is guilty. Freddie Firefly tells Benjamin Bat to leave and if he ever comes back, he will bring Solomon Owl to his tree. Benjamin Bat tries to get away, but is terrified of being burned by Freddie Firefly's light. Freddie Firefly is amused and dances around the dooryard. When he comes back, Benjamin Bat is gone and he is never seen again.

Story so far:  The speaker cautions against being careless, as it could lead to losing one's wings. Freddie Firefly scolds Benjamin Bat for trying to eat him, warning him that he will bring Solomon Owl next time if he tries it again. Benjamin Bat is greatly surprised when Freddie Firefly suggests that it would be just as jolly for Benjamin to be eaten by Solomon Owl as it would be for Freddie to be eaten by Benjamin. Freddie Firefly knows that Benjamin Bat is scared, but he does not know why. Benjamin is afraid of being singed by Freddie. Freddie finds this amusing.

Last chunk: Just tell him I'm in trouble," he whined.  "Trouble!" Freddie Firefly sneered, for he knew well enough--by this  time--that Benjamin Bat was scared, though he couldn't quite guess the  reason for Benjamin's fright. "You'll be in worse trouble if I show  Solomon Owl where you sleep in the daytime."  "Stand back!" Benjamin Bat shrieked suddenly. "You'll singe my wings if  you're not careful!"  Then Freddie Firefly knew exactly what Benjamin feared. And he was so  amused that he couldn't help
