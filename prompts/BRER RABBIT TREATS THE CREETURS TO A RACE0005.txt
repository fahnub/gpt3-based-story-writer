Outline: A group of animals are racing to Moscow before the close of day. The first to leave is a butterfly riding on a frog. Next is a water rat floating on a log, followed by a caterpillar on the fence and a hopper in the hay. The animals all race as fast as they can, but it's unclear who will make it to Moscow first.

Story so far: The passage describes how a crow boasted that it could fly faster than a train, but was later outpaced by Brer Rabbit in a race. The other animals became angry and chased Brer Rabbit, but he was able to clean himself off while they were still covered in mud. Mr. Crow then challenged the Rainmaker to a race, which he won. A man comes down the road, coughing and sneezing. He affects all the animals, who all start coughing and sneezing too. Brer Dust nearly buries Brer Bear. A cloud crops up and Uncle Win and Cousin Rain get out. The race begins and Uncle Win blows his bellows.
