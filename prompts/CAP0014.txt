Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of Cap'n Bill and Cap'n Joe, who are both under water, and their efforts to move a stepladder. They are joined by Brownie Beaver, who is stuck under a tree trunk. The three eventually find themselves in the company of the "awful creature" Zog. Zog is described as being always angry and the reason for this is given as the fact that he is always busy. Cap'n Bill and Cap'n Joe are long-lost brothers. Brownie Beaver is stuck under a tree that fell on him and tries to call for help. Daddy Longlegs wasn't worried when he heard the other animals talking about the dangerous valley because he knew they couldn't hurt him. Trot and Cap'n Bill discuss Joe after his awkward re-entrance. Cap'n Bill is worried that Joe looks so much like him, including the wooden leg. Captain Tickle had a nickel in a paper sack. He threw it in the river and couldn't get it back. Captain Tickle spent his nickel for a rubber ball. When he cut it open, there was nothing there at all. Cap'n Joe is a fish who used to be a human. He was shipwrecked and would have drowned if a mermaid hadn't found him and turned him into a fish. He says he's not too unhappy with his new life, although it is quite different from his previous one.

"There ain't much  excitement here, fer we don't catch a flock o' mermaids ev'ry day,  but the work is easy an' the rations fair. I might o' been worse  off, you know, for when my brig was wrecked, I'd 'a' gone to Davy  Jones's Locker if Zog hadn't happened to find me an' made me a  fish."  "You don't look as much
