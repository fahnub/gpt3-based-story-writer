Story so far: The passage describes a group of friends who make and sell wine. They are successful until they are caught by the vicar. The narrator is glad they got the Castilian Amoroso, because it cheered their father up. They note that it is not always possible to make their father happy, even if they try. The passage describes a scene in which two girls are upset after being told to leave a bottle and glass at a clergyman's house. When they return home, they find that tea is ready and there is a teacake. Dora is crying and Alice is comforting her. Oswald went to look for the corkscrew in order to see what was inside the bottle. He found it in the dresser drawer, and when he got back, the others had read most of the printed papers. Dora said that she didn't think it was much good to sell wine, and that it wasn't easy to suddenly begin to sell things when you weren't used to it. A customer at a wine shop asks Alice what her commission is on half-dozens and then proceeds to give her a shilling. Alice is confused, as she thought the wine people paid that, but the butcher says they don't.

Last chunk: some  more to drink.  'No, thank you, miss,' he said; 'it's my favourite wine, but it doesn't  agree with me; not the least bit. But I've an uncle drinks it. Suppose I  ordered him half a dozen for a Christmas present? Well, miss, here's the  shilling commission, anyway,' and he pulled out a handful of money and  gave her the shilling.  'But I thought the wine people paid that,' Alice said.  But the butcher said not on half-dozens they didn't. Then he said he  didn't think he'd wait any longer
