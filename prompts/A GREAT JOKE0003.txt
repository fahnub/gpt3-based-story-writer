Outline: This is a playful poem about a child who is eager to eat their meal. The child is excited about the food they are going to have and the prospect of eating it. The poem speaks to the child's innocence and their joy in the simple things in life.

Story so far:  The passage describes a black and white dog who is particular about keeping his long hair neatly parted in the middle. Benny was a beaver who loved to dig holes. He was so good at it that other animals sometimes used his holes as homes. Benny dug so many holes that some of his neighbors started to object. The young black ram is on the farm and Snowball tells him to leave before the old dog finds him.

Last chunk: For Snowball noticed that he ate grass.  "He's a queer creature. And whatever he may be, Spot's sure to dislike  him. So I'll advise him to run along, anyhow," Snowball decided.  So Snowball called out, "There's an old dog on this farm that will chase  you if he catches you here. You'd better go away before he finds you."  To Snowball's amazement the stranger looked at him boldly and said,  "_Baa-a-a!_" Then, in a flash, Snowball knew that it was the voice of  the young black ram, and no other.
