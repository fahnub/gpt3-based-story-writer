Outline: Dorothy and her friends are sitting in the throne room of the royal palace in the Emerald City, awaiting the arrival of the invited guests for Ozma's birthday celebration. The first to arrive are the gingerbread man, King Dough the First, and his head booleywag (a child-like creature), Chick the Cherub, followed by a rubber bear. They are all from the Kingdoms of Hiland and Loland and Dorothy introduces them to the others.

Next to arrive is a tall, beautiful woman clad in an exquisite trailing gown - the Sorceress known as Glinda the Good. She is warmly welcomed by all and escorted to her room by fifty servants.

Then comes Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T.E., head professor at the Royal College of Oz, who wishes to read an Ode he has composed in honor of Ozma's birthday; but the Scarecrow won't let him.

After that, Billina and her ten fluffy chicks enter the room and Dorothy runs down from her seat to pet them. They are all wearing lockets with her picture inside.

Lastly, Tik-tok the clock-work man comes in, all wound up and working fine. He is followed by a procession of more foreign dignitaries and the High Chamberlain announces each of them as they enter.

When all the guests have arrived, they are seated and a feast is served. After the meal, there is much merriment and dancing and the guests enjoy themselves immensely. As the evening draws to a close, they all retire to their rooms and the palace is quiet once more.

The people of the Emerald City are cheering for a band of musicians approaching down the street. Dorothy sees them and wonders what they're cheering for. The passage describes the arrival of the Sorceress Glinda the Good at the palace of Ozma, the ruler of the land of Oz. Glinda is warmly welcomed by Dorothy, a young girl from Kansas who is one of Ozma's closest friends. The Scarecrow has had his face repainted and he feels like himself again. He is pleased to have been able to have it done.

Last chunk: most  beloved man in all the Land of Oz.  "Why, your face has been newly painted!" exclaimed Dorothy, when the  first greetings were over.  "I had it touched up a bit by the Munchkin farmer who first made me,"  answered the Scarecrow, pleasantly.  "My complexion had become a bit  grey and faded, you know, and the paint had peeled off one end of my  mouth, so I couldn't talk quite straight.  Now I feel like myself  again, and I may say without immodesty that my body is stuffed with the  loveliest
