Outline: Rusty Wren is a small bird who is very happy to have found a bunch of tobacco leaves in the carriage house on the farm. He goes home to get his wife so she can see it too, but she is uninterested. She shows him an egg in their nest and he is very happy, singing to her. They never mention the tobacco again.

Story so far:  Rusty Wren is angry with his wife for buying tobacco, but he soon realizes that he left the tobacco upstairs in the carriage house. This passage describes a moment when Rusty Wren peered into a bird's nest and found a large egg. He was so surprised and happy that he started singing. His wife seemed pleased, and from then on she stopped smoking.

Last chunk: peering into the nest, Rusty saw a speckled egg there. It was  really a small egg. But to Rusty Wren's eyes it seemed decidedly  big.  He was so surprised that he couldn't speak for as much as two  seconds. And then he began to sing--he was so happy.  Though Mrs. Rusty kept very still, she seemed much pleased. And,  strange to say, she never mentioned _smoking_ to her husband again.  She had something more important to think about.
