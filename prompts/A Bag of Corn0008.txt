Outline: Frisky Squirrel and Uncle Sammy Coon go to Farmer Green's place to steal corn. Frisky climbs into the corn-house through a hole in the wall and begins dropping corn out for Uncle Sammy to pick up. After a while, Frisky peeks out of the hole to see what's taking Uncle Sammy so long, and is surprised to see that he has run away with the bag of corn. Frisky narrowly escapes getting caught by Farmer Green, and decides not to tell his mother about the incident. The next day, he runs into Uncle Sammy again and confronts him about the stolen corn. Uncle Sammy denies taking it, but Frisky doesn't believe him.

Story so far:  Two animals are planning to steal corn from a farmer's storehouse. They will do so by climbing a tree and crawling through a hole in the wall. Frisky is puzzled when Uncle Sammy says they will divide the bag of corn between them later, and hurries up the tree to get his share. Uncle Sammy explains to Frisky Squirrel that he will be doing most of the work in their corn-picking operation, as he will be the one staying outside to collect the corn dropped through a hole in the wall. A boy is upset that he didn't get any corn, and his uncle laughs.

Last chunk: "You'll get your own corn next time," he snapped. And as he skipped  away he heard Uncle Sammy Coon laugh heartily--just as though something  had amused him.
