Outline: A man named Blue Beard has a lot of money and property, but he also has a blue beard which makes him very ugly and scares away all the women and girls. One of his neighbors has two daughters who are very beautiful, and he asks to marry one of them. The daughters are hesitant because of Blue Beard's beard and the fact that he has married and murdered several wives in the past, but they eventually agree to marry him and go to his country estate for a week.

While they are at the estate, Blue Beard tells his wife that he has to go on a business trip for six weeks and gives her the keys to all his properties. He tells her not to go into one particular closet on the ground floor, but she is very curious and eventually gives in to temptation. Inside the closet, she finds the dead bodies of Blue Beard's previous wives.

Blue Beard comes back from his trip early and realizes that his wife has been in the closet. He threatens to kill her, but she is saved at the last minute by her brothers, who kill Blue Beard instead. She inherits all of his property and lives happily ever after.

When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her:--  "Sister Anne,"--for that was her name,--"go up, I beg you, to the top of the tower, and look if my brothers are not coming; they promised me they would come to-day, and if you see them, give them a sign to make
