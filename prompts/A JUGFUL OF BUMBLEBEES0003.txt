Outline: The Bumblebee family is out in the meadow when they notice a jug. Buster Bumblebee is curious about the jug and goes to investigate. He hears a roaring noise from inside the jug and tells the other bees that there is an enemy inside. The bees all fly into the jug and are subsequently captured by Johnnie Green. Johnnie takes the jug and shakes it, then sets it down and goes to get more water. The bees inside the jug start to stir and eventually fly out. They are disoriented and don't know what happened. The other bees blame Buster for the incident and are forever remarking on how lazy and stupid he is.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green is pleased after he corked a jug that held angry bumblebees, breaking up their home. Johnnie plans to drown all the stinging insects on his farm, but is unsure about mosquitoes. He pours the contents of the jug onto the ground, killing many bees in the process. Buster Bumblebee and the other workers mistake a jug for the enemy, and they buzz around it menacingly. The workers decided that the whole trouble was Buster's fault and started to treat him worse. The passage describes how a group of half-drowned animals gradually revive in the sun. They never know exactly what happened, but the workers agree that it was probably a miracle. The passage tells the story of a group of bumblebees who become angry when they hear a scraping sound in their home. They rush to the front door to investigate and find a strange object close to the door. Buster Bumblebee joins the group and they all sail out into the open meadow to investigate. The workers realize that the enemy is inside the jug, so they all go in to sting him. Johnnie Green had left the jug uncorked, so it was easy for them to get inside.

Last chunk: help hearing the same roaring from  inside it to which Johnnie Green had listened with so much pleasure.  "Buster's almost right!" several of the workers shouted. "The enemy has  hidden inside this thing. And we'll have to go in and sting him."  At that the workers began to pop into the jug, which Johnnie Green had  thoughtfully left uncorked. And Buster Bumblebee, still eager to see  everything, hastened to plunge inside the dim jug along with the rest.  It was soon not a dim but a dark jug.
