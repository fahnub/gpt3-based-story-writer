Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far: The passage describes a meal with unknown dishes, which the child is suspicious of. Cap'n Bill eats everything without questioning it, so the child decides to do the same. They learn that the ice cream they are eating comes from icebergs. A sailor encounters an eel, which snaps at his face. The passage describes water as being alive and beautiful, with a variety of colors. The child in the passage sees the water as being like jelly, and is fascinated by its ability to move in any direction.

Last chunk: brightly,  and soon the sailor was puffing the smoke from his pipe in great  contentment. The smoke ascended through the water in the shape of  bubbles, and Trot wondered what anyone who happened to be floating  upon the surface of the ocean would think to see smoke coming from  the water.  "Well, I find I can smoke, all right," remarked Cap'n Bill, "but it  bothers me to understand why."  "It is because of the air space existing between the water and  everything you have about you," explained
