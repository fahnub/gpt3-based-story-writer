Story so far: This passage describes various animals and their personality traits. Katy is a secret nobody knows about, except for Kiddie Katydid and his family. Many people remembered hearing her name mentioned the year before, but had forgotten about her until the Katydids brought her back to their minds in August. Mr. Rusty Wren is scolded by his wife for flicking a tiny scrap on the floor without thinking. Mrs. Pig is upset because her piglet, Grunty, has run away and she fears he has been caught by a bear. She regrets not keeping a closer eye on him.

Last chunk: --more  than a command--to stop Grunty from running away. For it wasn't long  before she missed him again.  If Mrs. Pig hadn't been so upset she might have been vexed--and with  good reason.  "Oh! that dear little Grunty!" she wailed. "The bear may have caught him  already, in the cabbage patch."  Then piercing squeals fell once more on Mrs. Pig's ears.  "Dear! Dear!" she cried. "I ought to have watched him. I ought to have  kept an eye on Grunty. After all, he's little more than a baby."
