Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far:  The barnacles are singing a nonsensical song, and Trot thinks it's stupid. The mermaids quietly rebuked the guests for arguing and being noisy, and reminded them that the queen's guests should be more careful. The dinner provided was delicious, with lobster soup, fried salmon, and oysters, among other seafood dishes. The mermaid warns Cap'n Bill and Trot to watch out for the snapping eels. The eels are very active and can be dangerous. The barnacles sing about how they were attached to a man-o'-war, but it ran away and went to sea. They were then gathered up by a halibut and taken to topsy-turvy land. The mermaids' guests found the meal very satisfying, and there was no danger of them being hungry while they remained the guests of the mermaids. The meal ended with ice cream, which surprised the child guests, since they thought it would be impossible to get ice at the bottom of the sea. The passage describes a meal with unknown dishes, which the child is suspicious of. Cap'n Bill eats everything without questioning it, so the child decides to do the same.

Last chunk: delicate leaf from some seaweed that Trot  thought was much nicer than lettuce. Several courses were served,  and the lobsters changed the plates with each course, chattering and  scolding as they worked, and as Trot said, "doing everything  backwards" in their nervous, fussy way.  Many of the things offered them to eat were unknown to the visitors,  and the child was suspicious of some of them, but Cap'n Bill asked  no questions and ate everything offered him, so Trot decided to  follow his
