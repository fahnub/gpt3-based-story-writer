Outline: Don Giovanni de la Fortuna is a man who spends all of his father's money and is left with nothing. He meets the devil, who gives him a purse that will give him money if he doesn't wash, shave, or change his clothes for three years. He agrees and becomes filthy and disgusting. He meets a man who is selling his house and, despite his appearance, buys it. He also borrows money from the king and agrees to marry the king's daughter. He is given two months to clean himself up and, when he arrives to marry the princess, she is disgusted by his appearance. However, her younger sister agrees to marry him and they have a happy life together.
