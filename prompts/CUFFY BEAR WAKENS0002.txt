Outline: Nimble, a deer, is out foraging for food when he happens upon the cave where he had waited for Cuffy Bear weeks before. He remembers how he had fed upon the green things under the snow and begins to paw away the snow to find more food.

Cuffy Bear, who had been inside the cave sleeping, wakes up and comes out to find Nimble. At first, Cuffy doesn't recognize Nimble because he has shed his horns since they last met. But once Cuffy realizes who Nimble is, he is surprised to see him because he had assumed Nimble would have left long ago.

Nimble tells Cuffy that he only stayed because he heard old dog Spot coming. Cuffy is relieved to hear this and the two animals go their separate ways.

Story so far:  Cuffy Bear and Nimble meet again after a long time apart. Cuffy Bear is surprised to see how much Nimble has changed, and Nimble points out that Cuffy Bear has changed too - he looks much hungrier. They decide to walk down the mountain together. Nimble, a deer, remembers the time he met Cuffy Bear and how he fed him green things. He thinks about this as he roams around the valley and up the side of the mountain. Nimble tells Cuffy Bear that he did not wait for him, but Cuffy Bear insists that Nimble must have been waiting for him. Nimble insists that he is a deer, and not a doe, despite having no horns. Cuffy Bear is surprised that Nimble broke his promise to wait inside the cave. Nimble and Cuffy Bear are on a mountain, and Cuffy Bear says he needs to go back to his cave to get his cap. Nimble says he's not going to wait, and trots off in the direction of Cedar Swamp. Nimble Deer tells Cuffy Bear that he has been asleep in the den all winter and only woke up because he heard Spot barking. Cuffy Bear is surprised and can't say anything. Nimble Deer is in a cave, pawing away at the snow to eat, when he hears a woof behind him. He turns to see Cuffy Bear at the mouth of the cave, peering over the tangle that screens it. Cuffy Bear blinks at Nimble Deer and growls, "Where's Nimble Deer, madam?" Nimble Deer replies, "I'm right here!"

Last chunk: under the snow.  That thought made him hungry. So he began to paw away the soft heavy  snow, which wasn't more than a foot deep; and he was enjoying a good  meal when he heard a sudden _woof_ behind him.  Nimble wheeled instantly. And there, at the mouth of the cave, peering  over the tangle which screened it, Cuffy Bear stood upon his hind legs,  rubbing his eyes. Catching sight of Nimble, Cuffy blinked at him.  "Where's Nimble Deer, madam?" Cuffy Bear growled presently.  "I'm right here!"
