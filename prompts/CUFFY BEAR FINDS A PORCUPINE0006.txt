Outline: Cuffy Bear and Silkie are playing in the front yard when Cuffy decides he wants to go to the old tree in the pine woods to play. Silkie reminds him that their mother told them not to go far away, but Cuffy doesn't care and goes anyway. When he gets to the old tree, he finds that it's much smaller than he expected because he's grown taller during the months he spent in sleep. He climbs to the top of the tree and sees a small animal covered in quills moving around in the snow. Cuffy remembers his father telling him never to touch a porcupine because if he does, he'll get his paws stuck full of quills. But he decides to show his father that he's clever enough to kill a porcupine, so he steps close to the porcupine and cuffs it with his paw. The next instant, Cuffy howls in pain and realizes that his paw is full of quills. He starts crying and makes his way home, where his mother has to pull the quills out of his paw. Cuffy never touches a porcupine again.

Story so far:  Cuffy, despite being told not to by his father, steps close to a porcupine and gets his paws stuck full of quills. Cuffy the bear cub tries to play with a porcupine and ends up with quills in his paws. He starts walking home on his hind legs, crying all the way. Cuffy Bear and Silkie are playing in the front yard when Cuffy remembers there is an old tree in the pine woods that would be fun to play in. Cuffy Bear's mother has told them not to go far away, but Cuffy Bear decides to go anyway. Cuffy finds a porcupine and gets hungry remembering that his father had brought home porcupine meat before. Cuffy, a young bear, learned his lesson after getting quills stuck in his paws and being fed frozen turnips by his mother.

Last chunk: very hard when Mrs. Bear pulled out the quills. And his paws  were so sore that he could not feed himself. His mother had to put into  his mouth bits of the frozen turnips that his father found in Farmer  Green's field. And though afterward Cuffy did many things that he ought  not to have done, he never, never touched a porcupine again.
