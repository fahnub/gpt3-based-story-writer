Outline: Captain Fyter was a soldier who fell in love with a beautiful Munchkin girl named Nimmie Amee. The Wicked Witch who didn't want them to be together enchanted his sword and he was gradually cut to pieces. He went to the tinsmith, Ku-Klip, who made him into a Tin Soldier. Nimmie Amee's tin sweetheart, Nick Chopper (the Tin Woodman), had disappeared and she took an interest in the Tin Soldier. They were going to elope on the day of their wedding, but the Wicked Witch came back and he had to stand in the forest rusting. The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Woot the Wanderer came across him and he told his story. They all decided that the Tin Soldier and the Tin Woodman should both go to Nimmie Amee's house and she could choose between them.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of a man who is planning to elope with a woman called Nimmie Amee. However, on his way to meet her, he is caught in a rainstorm and his limbs begin to rust. He becomes frightened and cries for help, but no one comes. The Tin Soldier and the Tin Woodman are discussing the Munchkin girl that the Soldier was in love with. The Soldier reveals that her name is Nimmie Amee, and the Woodman is surprised to hear this. They all then wonder if Nimmie Amee loved the Soldier back. The Scarecrow, Polychrome, the Tin Soldier, and the Tin Woodman all agree that the best way to find the girl a husband is to let her choose for herself.

Last chunk: Why don't you draw lots for her?"  "That wouldn't be right," said the Scarecrow.  "The girl should be permitted to choose her own husband," asserted Polychrome. "You should both go to her and allow her to take her choice. Then she will surely be happy."  "That, to me, seems a very fair arrangement," said the Tin Soldier.  "I agree to it," said the Tin Woodman, shaking the hand of his twin to show the matter was settled. "May I ask your name, sir?" he continued.  "Before I was so cut up," replied
