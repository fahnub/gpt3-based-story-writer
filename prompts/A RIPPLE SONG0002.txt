Outline: A young woman is out walking near a river when she sees a ripple in the water. She stops to watch it, and the ripple speaks to her, saying that it is Death. The woman is not afraid, and she tells Death that she is not afraid to go with him because her lover is calling her. Death then takes her away in the water.

Story so far:  A ripple comes ashore and is found by a maiden. The ripple tells the maiden that it is Death, come to take her away. The maiden does not fear Death, and goes with him willingly. A maiden is ferried across a river by Death, who warns her to wait for him when her lover calls. The maiden does not heed his warning and instead rushes off to meet her lover. Death follows close behind her, leaving a trail of blood in the water.

Last chunk: ferry-cart.     "Wait, ah, wait!" the ripple saith;     "Maiden, wait, for I am Death!"     "When my lover calls I haste--     Dame Disdain was never wedded!"     Ripple-ripple round her waist,     Clear the current eddied.     Foolish heart and faithful hand,     Little feet that touched no land.     Far away the ripple sped,     Ripple--ripple--running red!
