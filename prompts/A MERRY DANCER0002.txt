Outline: Freddie Firefly is a small, sprightly creature who loves to dance and play at night. He is often joined by his family and friends, and they flash their lights through the darkness, enjoying the warm summer nights.

However, not everyone appreciates Freddie and his merry dancing. Benjamin Bat is one of those who find fault with the fireflies, and he grumbles that they should be spending their time in a more serious way.

Solomon Owl claims that there is another reason why Benjamin doesn't like Freddie Firefly - Benjamin would like to eat Freddie, but he doesn't dare to grab him for fear of getting burned by Freddie's light.

Some people in the community thought the Firefly family was wasting their time by dancing instead of doing something more productive. Benjamin Bat was one of those people and he especially did not like Freddie Firefly because he was proud of his light.

Last chunk: of the field people,  as well as the folk that lived in the farmhouse, thought that the  dancers made a pretty sight.  But there were others who said that the Firefly family might better be  spending their time in some more serious way.  Benjamin Bat, who lived in Cedar Swamp, was one of those who found fault  with the merry dancers. He grumbled a good deal about them--and  especially about Freddie Firefly.  "He's so proud of that light he carries!" Benjamin often exclaimed,  "Now, if he could
