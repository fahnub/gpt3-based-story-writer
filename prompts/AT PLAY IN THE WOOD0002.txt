Outline: Little Red Riding-Hood is taking a leisurely stroll through the woods, stopping to watch the butterflies and other animals. She eventually meets Hugh, the woodman, who asks her where she's going. She tells him she's going to her grandmother's house and then hurries on her way.

Story so far:  Little Red Riding-Hood was playing in the wood and enjoying the company of the animals there. She ran after the butterflies and watched the squirrels play. Little Red Riding Hood is on her way to her grandmother's house when she meets Hugh, the woodman. He asks her where she is going and she tells him. He tells her to hurry along because it is getting late.

Last chunk: every now and then a  rabbit would hurry away through the tall ferns, or a great bee come  buzzing near her, and she would stop to watch it gathering honey from  the flowers, and wild thyme. So she went on very slowly. By-and-by she  saw Hugh, the woodman. "Where are you going, Little Red Riding-Hood,"  said he, "all alone?"  [Illustration: LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD CATCHING BUTTERFLIES.]  "I am going to my grand mammaâ€™s," said the child. "Good day; I must make  haste now, for it grows late."
