Outline: Henrietta Hen is a mother who is trying to teach her child to swim in the duck-pond. However, the child seems to have no intention of minding her or of drowning. When Henrietta's neighbors come to see what the commotion is about, they tell her that the child is a duckling and that the water won't hurt him.

Henrietta is astonished but soon begins to boast about her son's swimming skills. However, her neighbors are unimpressed and tell her that they don't want any swimmers in their families. Henrietta then announces that every brood should have at least one swimmer in it.

The duckling continues to swim away and Henrietta is eventually forced to go home without him. Her own children ask about the duckling but Henrietta says that they are better off without him and that she never liked him very well.

Story so far:  The young duckling is swimming away from his foster mother, who is realizing that he is different from her other children. The ducks on the pond do not want any swimmers in their family, but Henrietta Hen insists that every brood should have at least one swimmer. A mother hen and her son discuss the latter's swimming skills. The mother hen insists that the son is not really hers, but rather a duck's egg that was placed under her while she was hatching her eggs. A group of ducks tell Henrietta Hen that the "chap" in the water is a duckling, and Henrietta begins to boast about it. Henrietta Hen is worried about her child, who is swimming in the duck pond and doesn't seem to be minding her. She makes so much noise that some of her neighbors come. The mother duck tells her children that she never liked the truant duckling very much and that they're better off without him.

"No!" said their mother. "We're well rid of him. He has been more trouble  to me than all the rest of you.... To tell the truth, I never liked him  very well."
