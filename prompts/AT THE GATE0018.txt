Outline: The story is set in a monastery, where the monks live a life of prayer and contemplation. One day, they decide to choose a beggar from the outside world to be their porter, in order to keep the 'evil' of the world from entering their holy place. The porter faithfully does his job, keeping out all who would disturb the peace of the monastery.

However, one Easter Eve, the porter allows a sick old man and other needy individuals into the monastery, saying that it is the will of God. The monks are forced to put aside their prayer and contemplation to tend to the needs of these people. They are surprised to find that, in doing so, they are fulfilling their prayers more than ever before.

The story ends with the old abbot feeling the beat of wings, knowing that his time has come to meet his Master in heaven.

Story so far: The passage describes the sound that God most loves to hear: the sound of people working hard. The speaker urges his brother to open the Abbey gates to God's poor, and to forgive him if he must chide them. The passage describes how the prayers of the righteous are sometimes drowned out by the cries of those who are suffering from injustice. However, when true love is shed on those who are suffering, their cries are transformed into something that is heard and welcomed in heaven. The passage describes a man who, on Easter Day, decides to open the gate to his abbey to anyone who needs help. From that day forward, the abbey is filled with people seeking succor and healing, and the man's prayers are answered with more praise than ever before. Only a lily now lies where the feet of the beloved once stood, and the old abbot feels the nearing beat of wings that will take him to meet his master. The passage discusses the power of prayer, how it can affect the natural world and bring about change. The porter in the passage seems to agree with this, but when the echo of the night's prayer dies away, he is reminded of how powerless he is. God makes everything better and we should be grateful. The speaker in the passage chides the Abbot, telling him that his brother loves him and that he (the speaker) died for him and his sheep. The Abbot then sees that the speaker has disappeared and that a lily has appeared in his place.

Last chunk: chide,    Thy Brother loves thee--and has loved--for see    The nails are in my hands, and in my side    The spear-wound; and the thorns weigh heavily    Upon my brow--brother, I died for thee--    For thee, and for my sheep that are astray,    And rose to live for thee, and them, on Easter Day!"      "My Master and my Lord!" the Abbot cried.    But, where that face had been, shone the new day;    Only on the marble by the Abbot's side,    Where those dear feet had stood, a lily lay--    A lily
