Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far: The passage describes a meal with unknown dishes, which the child is suspicious of. Cap'n Bill eats everything without questioning it, so the child decides to do the same. Trot and Cap'n Bill learn that the ice cream they are eating comes from icebergs. The barnacles in the passage are singing a song that, according to the mermaid, usually has no meaning. However, the child asks if they write comic operas, to which the mermaid replies that they seem to enjoy the songs they sing. A sailor encounters an eel, which snaps at his face. The eel is unafraid of the mermaids, who have the power to stiffen them. The passage describes water as being alive and beautiful, with a variety of colors. The child in the passage sees the water as being like jelly, and is fascinated by its ability to move in any direction. The passage describes two fish guarding an avenue in a sea garden. When asked if all is quiet, one of the guards reports that a third fish was sick earlier but is better now and has gone to sleep. The passage describes the lobster slaves of the mermaids, who are clumsy and often drop the food they are carrying. Trot finds them amusing to watch.

Last chunk: but her curiosity was soon  satisfied when several large lobsters came sliding into the room  backward, bearing in their claws trays loaded with food. Each of  these lobsters had a golden band behind its neck to show it was the  slave of the mermaids.  These curious waiters were fussy creatures, and Trot found much  amusement in watching their odd motions. They were so spry and  excitable that at times they ran against one another and upset the  platters of food, after which they began to scold
