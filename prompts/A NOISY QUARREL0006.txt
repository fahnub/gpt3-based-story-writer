Outline: The Hermit Thrush decides to settle a dispute between his cousins, old Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay, by arranging a race between Bobby Bobolink and Benjamin Bat. The two birds are known for their respective talents - Bobby Bobolink is an agile flier, while Benjamin Bat is known for being able to travel long distances.

The Hermit Thrush first tries to persuade Benjamin Bat to change his habits and stay awake during the day, but when that doesn't work, he asks Bobby Bobolink to stay up at night. In the end, both birds agree to the race.

The race is held, and to everyone's surprise, Bobby Bobolink wins. Old Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay are forced to admit that they were wrong about Bobby Bobolink, and the three cousins reconcile.

Story so far:  The Hermit asks Jasper Jay and Benjamin Bat to let him speak to Bobby Bobolink, because he wants Bobby to stay awake some day to oblige him. However, the Hermit says that Bobby would probably sing his most boisterous song and wake him up, so it wouldn't work out.

"Why don't  you ask him to stay awake some night?"  But the Hermit said that that wouldn't suit him at all. "The Bobolink  person would be sure to sing his most boisterous song," he said, "and it  would wake me up and spoil my night's sleep. Let me speak to Benjamin  Bat!" he urged the two cousins.  And in the end they let him have his way.
