Outline: Dorothy and her friends are sitting in the throne room of the royal palace in the Emerald City, awaiting the arrival of the invited guests for Ozma's birthday celebration. The first to arrive are the gingerbread man, King Dough the First, and his head booleywag (a child-like creature), Chick the Cherub, followed by a rubber bear. They are all from the Kingdoms of Hiland and Loland and Dorothy introduces them to the others.

Next to arrive is a tall, beautiful woman clad in an exquisite trailing gown - the Sorceress known as Glinda the Good. She is warmly welcomed by all and escorted to her room by fifty servants.

Then comes Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T.E., head professor at the Royal College of Oz, who wishes to read an Ode he has composed in honor of Ozma's birthday; but the Scarecrow won't let him.

After that, Billina and her ten fluffy chicks enter the room and Dorothy runs down from her seat to pet them. They are all wearing lockets with her picture inside.

Lastly, Tik-tok the clock-work man comes in, all wound up and working fine. He is followed by a procession of more foreign dignitaries and the High Chamberlain announces each of them as they enter.

When all the guests have arrived, they are seated and a feast is served. After the meal, there is much merriment and dancing and the guests enjoy themselves immensely. As the evening draws to a close, they all retire to their rooms and the palace is quiet once more.

Billina tells the Head Booleywag that she is glad her chicks have a parent, because they will have more fun worrying her than if they were raised in an Incubator. Button-Bright is unsure about whether or not he is as bright as a button, but Jack Pumpkinhead arrives with a present for Ozma consisting of a necklace of pumpkin seeds. In each seed is set a sparkling carolite, which is considered the rarest and most beautiful gem that exists. The band plays again, announcing more arrivals. Dorothy has breakfast with Polly and the shaggy man, and they are rejoined by Toto. They hear the sound of a brass band playing, which means that the guests Dorothy invited are arriving. The passage describes Billina and her ten chicks entering the Throne-Room. Dorothy is excited to see them and runs down to pet them. Each chick is wearing a gold chain with a locket that has the letter "D" on it.

Last chunk: let him.  Soon they heard a clucking sound and a chorus of "cheep! cheep!" and a  servant threw open the door to allow Billina and her ten fluffy chicks  to enter the Throne-Room.  As the Yellow Hen marched proudly at the  head of her family, Dorothy cried, "Oh, you lovely things!" and ran  down from her seat to pet the little yellow downy balls.  Billina wore  a pearl necklace, and around the neck of each chicken was a tiny gold  chain holding a locket with the letter "D" engraved upon the
