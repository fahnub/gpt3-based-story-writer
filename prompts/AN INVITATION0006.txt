Outline: Rusty Wren's cousin, Long Bill, is having a party tomorrow at his home near Black Creek and has sent old Mr. Crow to deliver the invitation. When Jolly Robin arrives with the message, Rusty is excited to attend but his wife is not pleased as it is a men's party. Rusty promises to help his wife with her house-cleaning tomorrow but is clearly eager to attend the party. His wife warns him that he will be busy at home. The next day, Rusty goes to the party while his wife stays home to clean.

Story so far:  Rusty's wife is upset about something, so he decides it is best if their visitor does not stay too long. Rusty says he is going to the orchard to hunt for insects and Mrs. Rusty tells him to remember that he has to be busy at home tomorrow.

Last chunk: must go back to the orchard, because he  had to take care of his children while his wife went out to make a  call.  Mrs. Rusty did not urge him to stay. And, since she seemed upset  over something, Rusty thought it just as well if their visitor did  not linger there too long.  "I was just going to the orchard myself to hunt for insects," said  Rusty. "So I'll go with you."  Mrs. Rusty shot a quick look at him.  "Remember! You're going to be busy at home to-morrow!" she warned  him.  "Yes! yes!"
