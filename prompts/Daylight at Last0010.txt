Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

Story so far:  The explorers find a melon on the ground and are delighted. The Ork offers to carry Trot and Cap'n Bill up the well, with Trot sitting on its shoulders and Cap'n Bill grabbing hold of its legs. The Ork is spinning Trot and Cap'n Bill around in the air, and they are both clinging to the Ork for dear life. A house has been built at the edge of the forest, and the speaker and Trot are going to see if anyone is living there. The Ork escapes the well and is relieved to be in the sunlight again. The Ork tells Cap'n Bill and Trot that he will take them with him when he leaves the cave, and Cap'n Bill expresses concern about falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The passage describes the Ork's sudden release of its passengers, which sent them rolling. Cap'n Bill was pleased with the Ork's care for them and found the place they landed pretty. Trot was curious about where they were.

Last chunk: release was so sudden that even with the creature's care for its  passengers Cap'n Bill struck the earth with a shock that sent him  rolling heel over head; but by the time Trot had slid down from her  seat the old sailor-man was sitting up and looking around him with much  satisfaction.  "It's sort o' pretty here," said he.  "Earth is a beautiful place!" cried Trot.  "I wonder where on earth we are?" pondered the Ork, turning first one  bright eye and then the other to this side and that. Trees
