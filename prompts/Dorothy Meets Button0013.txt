Story so far: The passage describes the Ork's reflection on the group's next steps, the Bumpy Man's discovery of someone buried in the snow, and the shaggy man's decision to name the boy Button-Bright. Button-Bright is curious about the Ork's tail, and asks to see how it works. The Ork explains that it is his tail and he reserves the right to whirl it himself. Button-Bright then proposes they go out and fly somewhere so he can see how the tail works. The Ork declines, saying he only flies when he is going somewhere. The passage describes Cap'n Bill's thoughts on how to solve the problem of the shrinking people. He believes that if the purple berries make anything grow bigger, they could find a way out of their troubles. The others do not understand his speech, and just then a chorus of shrill cries is heard from outside. The Bumpy Man tells Trot that the birds she caught are educated to talk, and asks Cap'n Bill to let them go. The passage describes a conversation between a group of birds and a man who is asking them to carry him and his companions. The birds are initially reluctant, but the man assures them that he can make them big and strong enough to do it. They agree, and he proceeds to use his magic to make them large enough to carry the group. The shaggy man says that every road leads somewhere, so he and Dorothy will eventually find a place if they keep travelling. He doesn't know where they will end up, but they will find out when they get there. The Bumpy Man tells Trot that the snow in Mo is good to eat, and that the only downside is that there is sometimes too much of it. Trot finds that the popcorn is crisp and slightly warm, and enjoys it. Dorothy agrees that the Shaggy Man's plan makes sense.

Last chunk: said Dorothy; "that seems reas'n'ble, Shaggy Man."
