Outline: A young girl pleads with her pet cock not to crow before daybreak, promising him a life of luxury if he complies. She promises him a gold comb and silver wings if he will only be quiet. But the cock ignores her pleas and crows loudly, alerting the farmer to the coming day. The girl is disappointed but the cock is content.
