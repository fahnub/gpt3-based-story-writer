Outline: Jennie Junebug is a fat, frolicsome ladybug who loves to eat leaves and play tricks on people. One day, a busybody tells Jennie that Mrs. Ladybug is going to have a talk with her about her eating habits. Jennie laughs and says that she will have fun with Mrs. Ladybug if she tries to talk to her.

Mrs. Ladybug finds Jennie that evening and tries to talk to her about stopping her leaf-eating ways. Jennie interrupts her and starts playing around, knocking Mrs. Ladybug down. Mrs. Ladybug gets angry and tries to speak to Jennie again, but Jennie just keeps playing and knocking her down.

Finally, Mrs. Ladybug gets so angry that she starts to chase Jennie around. Jennie leads her on a merry chase until they come to a pond. Jennie then dives into the pond and Mrs. Ladybug can't follow her. Jennie resurfaces and laughs at Mrs. Ladybug, who is angry and frustrated.

Story so far:  Jennie Junebug is angry at the prospect of having to talk to Mrs. Ladybug, who is known for talking too much. The tale-bearer who told Jennie about Mrs. Ladybug says they only meant for Jennie to enjoy making her keep still, not to hurt her. Jennie Junebug insists she would never hurt Mrs. Ladybug. Ladybug is blown away by a gust of wind and dizzy. Jennie Junebug laughs, then sees Freddie Firefly's light and runs away. Jennie's friend is worried that Jennie will hurt Mrs. Ladybug if she plays with her too roughly. Jennie finds this amusing and laughs. Mrs. Ladybug tries to talk to Miss Junebug, but Jennie Junebug interrupts her and starts playing roughly. Mrs. Ladybug tries to talk to her again, but Jennie just knocks her down. Mrs. Ladybug asks Jennie Junebug if she has time to talk, and Jennie says she can only spare a few seconds because she's going to watch Freddie Firefly dance in the meadow.

Last chunk: evening!" said Mrs. Ladybug as soon as she spied Miss Junebug.  "Have you a few minutes to spare? If you have, I'd like to talk with  you."  Jennie Junebug grinned broadly.  "I can give you a few seconds of my valuable time," she replied. "I was  just going over to the meadow, for Freddie Firefly will be there soon.  He dances in the meadow every night. And I like to see his flickering  light--and watch him bounce when I hit him. So you'll have to talk fast,  for I'm in a hurry," said Jennie
