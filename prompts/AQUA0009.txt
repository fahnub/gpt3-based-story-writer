Outline: Aqua is a water droplet who lives in the ocean with his mother. He grows tired of playing in the ocean and begs the sun to take him on a journey to see the earth. The sun agrees and transforms Aqua into vapor so that he can ride on the sunbeams.

Aqua has a grand time sailing through the air and looking down at the world below, but when the sun sets he grows scared and tries to return to the ocean. He falls back to earth and lands in a rosebush. The next day he tries again and this time he ends up in a flour mill, where he and his fellow water droplets work the machinery.

Eventually Aqua and his brothers end up in a river which leads them back to the ocean. Aqua is happy to be back home with his mother and tells her all about his adventures.

Story so far:  A man and his brothers run to a mountain brook and hear a strange noise. They find a flour mill and see that the big wheel is making the stones inside spin really fast. This fable is about a water baby who is both above and below the surface of the water, and is stirred by the life around him. The passage describes how water droplets become vapor, and how they can rise high into the sky. This passage describes the dangers that Aqua and his brother water-drops face on their journey around the world. Aqua travels to the ocean where he is embraced by the water-drops. Aqua is a drop of water who falls from the sky and becomes frightened as the sun sets. He tries to get back to the earth, and grows heavier as he falls lower, until he is a drop of water again, landing on a rosebush. This passage describes how water droplets can grind wheat into flour and corn into meal, and how they can also spin a giant wheel. The brook where they live leads to a pond where ducks and geese swim.

Last chunk: and these stones ground the wheat into flour and the corn into  golden meal.  But what giant do you suppose it was who could turn and swing that  tremendous wheel, together with those heavy stones? No giant at all.  No one but our tiny little water-drops themselves, who sprang on it by  hundreds and thousands, and whirled it over and over.  The brook emptied into a quiet pond where ducks and geese were swimming.  Such a still, beautiful place it was, with the fuzzy, brown cat-tails  lifting
