Outline: Mr. Frog brings a present for Kiddie Katydid - an overcoat - all the way from the creek. Kiddie is pleased, but a little bit anxious, as he only wears green. Mr. Frog assures him that the overcoat is green and hangs it on a twig for Kiddie to try on later. He then goes back to the watering trough to wet his feet. When he comes back, Kiddie has already tried on the overcoat and loves it.

Story so far:  Mr. Frog has made an overcoat for Kiddie Katydid and is delivering it to him. Kiddie Katydid is pleased with the gift and grateful to Mr. Frog. Mr. Frog tells Kiddie Katydid that he will go hang the coat up and wet his feet, and while he is gone, she can try the coat on. Kiddie Katydid is anxious that the coat is green, because that is her favorite color. Mr. Frog assures her that he will not make a mistake and then leaves.

The insects are worried they will be in trouble with Mr. Crow tomorrow because they haven't visited Kiddie Katydid yet. Chirpy Cricket reassures them that Katydid will have gone into hiding for the night, so they don't need to worry.

Last chunk: Freddie Firefly complained  that his light didn't warm him in the least. And he said he would have  to go home at once.  "Mr. Crow will be very angry with us to-morrow when he learns we haven't  called on Kiddie Katydid," somebody remarked. And a hush fell upon the  company. But Chirpy Cricket had a happy thought, which made them all  feel better.  "Kiddie Katydid won't stay out of doors on a night like this!" he  suddenly exclaimed.
