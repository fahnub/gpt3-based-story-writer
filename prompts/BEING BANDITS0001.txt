Story so far: A group of friends plan to play a game of war on the Heath, a large park in London. This person thinks that fireworks are not as fun as they seem because you get tired of them quickly. They also think that setting them off in the fire is the only amusing way to use them, but that it is not allowed. This passage describes a group of children sitting around a fire, roasting chestnuts and listening to stories told by their uncle. He tells them that he enjoys seeing them play and have fun, and that he doesn't think it hurts their friend Albert to do the same. The passage describes a game played by three siblings, in which one of them pretends to be a prisoner and the others try to rescue him. The prisoner (H.O.) has to prick his own thumb to prove his bravery, and the siblings take turns doing this. Alice is whispering to a prisoner that it will soon be over, and the prisoner stops howling. The Bandit Captain pretends not to hear what Alice said. The letter says that Albert Morrison will be released if his relatives pay three thousand pounds. Noel becomes bored after they find the princess and the others want to do something to snap him out of it.

Last chunk: BEING BANDITS (Fiction:- Ages 5 to 9)  Noel was quite tiresome for ever so long after we found the Princess. He  would keep on wanting to go to the Park when the rest of us didn't, and  though we went several times to please him, we never found that door  open again, and all of us except him knew from the first that it would  be no go.  So now we thought it was time to do something to rouse him from the  stupor of despair, which is always done to heroes when anything baffling  has occurred.
