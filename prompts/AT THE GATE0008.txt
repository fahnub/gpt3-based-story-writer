Outline: The story is set in a monastery, where the monks live a life of prayer and contemplation. One day, they decide to choose a beggar from the outside world to be their porter, in order to keep the 'evil' of the world from entering their holy place. The porter faithfully does his job, keeping out all who would disturb the peace of the monastery.

However, one Easter Eve, the porter allows a sick old man and other needy individuals into the monastery, saying that it is the will of God. The monks are forced to put aside their prayer and contemplation to tend to the needs of these people. They are surprised to find that, in doing so, they are fulfilling their prayers more than ever before.

The brothers hastened to the gate, and there    With unaccustomed hand and voice they tried    To ease the body's pain, the spirit's care;    But ere
