Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Last chunk: always, as Sanch was, and I couldn't keep him  if I had him."  Ben tried to be grateful, but nothing short of Lita would have healed  his wounded heart, and she was not Thorny's to give, or he would  probably have offered her to his afflicted friend.  "Well, no, you couldn't take Jack to bed with you, or keep him up in  your room, and I'm afraid he Would never learn to do any thing clever. I  do wish I had something you wanted, I'd so love to give it to you."  He spoke so heartily and was so
