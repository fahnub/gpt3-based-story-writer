Story so far:  A woman is asked how she would feel if she found a lot of money, and she says that it would be nice but that it is just a legend.

The lady was very happy and the children helped her to get the treasure. The lady closes the door and says she hasn't heard an English voice in a long time. The boys are embarrassed because the floors are so clean. There is a small, bright fire in the room. The Phoenix speaks excellent French and tells the lady that it is also fluent in English. The children are surprised and horrified that the Phoenix would ask the lady why she is sad near Christmas time. Robert and Jane are discussing what to do with the bones they find in the castle.
