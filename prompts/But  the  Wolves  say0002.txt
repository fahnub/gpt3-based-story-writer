Outline: A group of wolves approach an elephant, asking for permission to take a small contribution of wool from the sheep in order to make coats for winter. The elephant agrees, but warns them to take only what they need and not to harm the sheep. The wolves take a fleece from each sheep, but also take an extra hair from each one. The sheep cry out in protest, but the wolves ignore them and continue taking what they need.

Story so far:  The wolves say that the sheep are stupid for complaining about having to give up a single fleece each, when they (the wolves) have to wear pelisses in winter. The Elephant says he will not permit this. The passage describes how taking a fleece from each person can help prevent injustice.

Last chunk: any  one  to  commit  injustice.    As  it  must  be  so,  take  a  fleece    from  each  of  them.    But  do  not  take  from  them  a  single  hair  besides."
