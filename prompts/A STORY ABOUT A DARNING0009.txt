Outline: The story is about a darning-needle who believes she is an embroidery-needle and is very proud. She is being used by the fingers to sew a shoe upper leather and is not happy with the common work. She breaks and is then stuck in the front of the cook's dress with sealing-wax. She is now a breast-pin and is very proud of herself. She talks to a bit of bottle-glass and they both think they are very costly. The bit of bottle-glass is washed away and the darning-needle is left. Two boys find her and stick her in an egg-shell. A wagon-wheel goes over her but she does not break.

Story so far: This passage describes a conversation between a darning needle and a bit of flax, in which they each express pride in their own origins. The darning needle comes from a work-box belonging to a cook, and is proud of the cook's five fingers, which it sees as a sign of nobility. The bit of flax, meanwhile, comes from a nobleman's coat and is proud of its own origins. The bit of bottle-glass is talking to other pieces of glass in a gutter, telling them about how it used to be part of a lamp. It says that it was the best of the lamp's parts, but it was broken and discarded. It is happy now, though, because it gets to sit in the sun and shine.

Goldband, the fourth, had a gold sash round his  waist; and little Playman did nothing at all, and was the more proud.  There was too much ostentation, and so I came away.'  'And now we are sitting and shining here!' said the bit of bottle-glass.  At that moment more water came into the gutter; it streamed over the  edges
