Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes a competition, a boy's abuse of animals, and a doctor's house visit. Ben is grateful for Thorny's friendship but feels sad because it comes so soon after another loss. The boys in the passage are disappointed to hear that their cousin was unable to find their lost dog. The owner of the black poodle they find says he bought the dog from a stranger and is also upset at the loss of the animal. The Muley Cow explains to Twinkleheels that a horse's record is the fastest time he ever makes in a race. Ebenezer then tells Twinkleheels that they will have another race the next time they're in the pasture together. Freddie Firefly knows that Benjamin Bat is scared, but he does not know why. Benjamin is afraid of being singed by Freddie. Freddie finds this amusing. Horace has killed the dog, but Thorny and Ben think he probably just ran away and will come back. A man plays an organ for a group of children, who are entertained by the music and the monkey.

Last chunk: and,  finding the organ a good one, the man a pleasant-faced Italian, and the  monkey a lively animal, he ordered them all in, as a delicate attention  to Ben, for music and monkey together might suggest soothing memories of  the past, and so be a comfort.  In they came by way of the Lodge, escorted by Bab and Betty, full of  glee, for hand-organs were rare in those parts, and the children  delighted in them. Smiling till his white teeth shone and his black eyes  sparkled, the man played away
