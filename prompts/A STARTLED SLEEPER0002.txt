Outline: Dickie Deer Mouse is looking for a new home, and has heard that Mr. Crow is moving. He goes to Mr. Crow's house to investigate, and finds the old gentleman asleep. When Dickie accidentally wakes him, Mr. Crow is startled and angry. He demands to know what Dickie is doing there, and Dickie explains that he thought Mr. Crow was moving. Mr. Crow tells him to leave, and Dickie does so. It is clear that Dickie will have to find a new home elsewhere.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow screams for help, flaps and flounders around, and Dickie Deer Mouse manages to slip away unnoticed. However, instead of running away, Dickie Deer Mouse hangs around and calls out to Mr. Crow, apologizing for disturbing him.

Last chunk: For a few moments Mr. Crow screamed loudly for help. And he flapped and  floundered about as if he didn't know which way to turn, nor what to do.  During the uproar Dickie Deer Mouse managed to slip out of Mr. Crow's  house without being seen. But he was too polite to run away. Instead of  hurrying off to escape a scolding from Mr. Crow he clung to a near-by  branch and called as loudly as he could:  "Don't be alarmed, sir! There's no one here but me. And I ask your  pardon for disturbing you."
