Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far: The passage describes a meal with unknown dishes, which the child is suspicious of. Cap'n Bill eats everything without questioning it, so the child decides to do the same. They learn that the ice cream they are eating comes from icebergs. A sailor encounters an eel, which snaps at his face. The passage describes water as being alive and beautiful, with a variety of colors.

The passage describes a room in one of Queen Aquareine's palaces, where a long table is laid out with gold dishes and dainty glassware. Around the table are rows of couches for the mermaids to recline on while they eat. Trot wonders who will serve the meal. The passage describes the sound of an Indian song, which gets louder as the listeners swim on. They eventually come to a big rock covered in tiny shells, which are making the chorus noise. The passage describes Trot's relief at being away from the eels, and Merla and Cap'n Bill's agreement that eels are not particularly pleasant creatures. The passage describes Mummercubble, a sea pig who is always complaining and is therefore not liked by the other sea creatures. Trot and Merla are glad he is taking a nap so they won't have to see him. The mermaid suggests that the sailor smoke his pipe, and he does so, rejoicing that his tobacco is not wet. The girl and sailor answer questions from the mermaids on their journey. The blonde mermaid leads Trot and Cap'n Bill to the flower gardens outside the palace walls. The old sailor remarks that he would feel better if he could have a smoke, and the mermaid asks why not.

Last chunk: who will show you some of the curious sights of our sea. You  need not go far this afternoon, and when you return, we will have  another interesting talk together."

"I'd feel all right, mate, if I could have a smoke," remarked the  old sailor to the child, "but that's a thing as can't be did here in  the water."  "Why not?" asked Merla, who overheard him.
