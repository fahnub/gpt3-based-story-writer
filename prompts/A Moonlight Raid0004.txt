Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is enjoying a party in the cornfield when they spot Fatty Coon approaching and everyone scatters. Master Meadow Mouse runs to his shock and curls up in his nest to try and take a nap. He feels safe since Mr. Crow has been visiting the cornfield everyday and has never bothered anyone.

Fatty Coon starts raiding the corn field, and Master Meadow Mouse complains each time he is woken up by the noise. Eventually, Fatty Coon tears down the entire shock that Master Meadow Mouse is hiding in and he is forced to flee. Fatty Coon catches him and eats him.

Story so far:  Master Meadow Mouse is trying to sleep, but is disturbed by Fatty Coon. Fatty Coon is only washing his ear of corn before he eats it. Fatty Coon pulled three ears of corn from the shock, devouring them each greedily. The third time he paused, cocking his ear towards the top of the shock.

Last chunk: in which he was  fussy. There was nothing, almost, that he wouldn't bolt greedily.  After he had devoured the first ear of corn, Fatty Coon went back and  pulled another off the same shock.  Again he roused Master Meadow Mouse from his slumbers.  "He's at it again!" Master Meadow Mouse complained. "I wish he'd go to  some other shock."  The third time that Fatty Coon wrenched an ear of corn from the shock  where Master Meadow Mouse lived he paused and cocked an ear towards the  top of the shock.
