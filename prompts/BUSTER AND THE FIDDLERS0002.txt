Outline: Buster Bumblebee's mother, the Queen, is worried that her workers won't make enough honey for the family's needs. Buster Bumblebee speaks up and says that he knows of a plan that could help - the honey-makers could work after dark if the Firefly family furnished lights for them.

The Queen liked the idea and sent Buster to talk with Freddie Firefly. Freddie Firefly agreed to help and soon the honey-makers were able to work after dark. Buster Bumblebee was very proud of himself and his successful plan.

Story so far: In the passage, Buster Bumblebee learns his lesson about being rude to others and boasting about things he's afraid of. He agrees to dance without music, since he enjoys dancing and finds the music played by the three fiddlers to be wonderful.

Buster's mother thinks his plan to get the Firefly family to provide lights for the honey-makers is a good one. The trumpeter's sister tells her that it's probably better for her to just play the gentleman, since she's so clumsy.

Bumblebee's family is very upset and he wants to know why. Buster's mother tells him to go talk to Freddie Firefly, and he is worried because he doesn't want to break his promise to never work. Farmer Green is hosting a raising bee, and all of his friends from miles around are invited. There will be plenty of food, and they may even have a dance in the afternoon. However, the passage is ultimately about a feast, and how it was short-lived due to how quickly the food was eaten. The people lingered and talked after the food was gone.
