Story so far: A group of friends are playing a game of war and preparing to capture an unwary traveller. They have chains to hold the captive and plan to ransom them back to their friends. The passage describes Albert's expectations for being ransomed, and the speaker's doubts about whether Albert is actually worth the ransom money. Dicky and Noel capture a cold, coughing boy and take him into the house against his will. The passage is about a family spending their last bit of money on presents for the father's birthday.

The child's friends are relieved and happy, and one of them gives the child a dried fruit as a snack. Oswald and his friends capture Albert-next-door and march him home in a hollow square. Alice apologizes to Albert-next-door's uncle for not thinking about his mother. They are interrupted by the arrival of Father, and Albert-next-door's uncle kisses Alice before they go down to meet him. Albert-next-door's uncle was angry because Albert had not come home.
