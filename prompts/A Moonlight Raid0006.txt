Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is enjoying a party in the cornfield when they spot Fatty Coon approaching and everyone scatters. Master Meadow Mouse runs to his shock and curls up in his nest to try and take a nap. He feels safe since Mr. Crow has been visiting the cornfield everyday and has never bothered anyone.

Fatty Coon starts raiding the corn field, and Master Meadow Mouse complains each time he is woken up by the noise. Eventually, Fatty Coon tears down the entire shock that Master Meadow Mouse is hiding in and he is forced to flee. Fatty Coon catches him and eats him.

Story so far:  Master Meadow Mouse is trying to sleep, but is disturbed by Fatty Coon. Fatty Coon is only washing his ear of corn before he eats it. Fatty Coon pulled three ears of corn from the shock, devouring them each greedily. The third time he paused, cocking his ear towards the top of the shock. Fatty Coon does not intend to leave soon. He begins to pull at the cornstalks with his claws, despite Farmer Green's attempts to bind them together. This causes alarm for Master Meadow Mouse.

Last chunk: soon appeared that Fatty Coon did not intend to leave. For Fatty  began to pull at the cornstalks with his claws. Although Farmer Green  had bound the stalks together tightly, one by one Fatty tore them loose  and let them fall upon the ground.  And inside the shock Master Meadow Mouse suddenly started up in alarm.      [Illustration]
