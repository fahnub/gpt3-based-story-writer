Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

Story so far: The children are captured by Scoodlers, who plan to make them into soup. They are saved by the shaggy man, who throws the Scoodlers' heads back into the gulf. They are all relieved to be safe. The passage describes the two-faced, headless creatures known as the Nomes, who terrorized the prisoners with their speed and eerie eyes. The Nomes led the prisoners away from the road and down a hill, using a side path. The Shaggy Man has a Love Magnet, and whoever meets him must love him and his friends. The Queen wants to make them into soup, but the Shaggy Man politely requests that they be allowed to go their way. Daughter is brought before the Queen of the Scoodlers, who is two-faced with one side being fiery red and the other side being bright yellow. The Scoodlers have a big soup kettle in the middle of their place, and they're shouting that they're hungry. Button-Bright is holding Dorothy and Polly's hands, and he's affected by the shout. Polychrome distracts the guard so the others can escape.

Whenever she  approached the shaggy man he would whisper something in her ear, and  Polly would nod her pretty head as if she understood.  The shaggy man told Dorothy and Button-Bright to stand before him while  he emptied the potatoes out of one of the sacks.  When this had been  secretly done, little Polychrome, dancing near to the guard, suddenly  reached out her hand and slapped his face, the next instant
