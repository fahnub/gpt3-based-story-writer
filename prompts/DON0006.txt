Outline: Benny Badger is out walking one night when he comes across Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox is a wily gentleman, and Benny Badger is immediately suspicious of him.

Benny Badger asks Mr. Fox what he is up to, and Mr. Fox claims he is just out for a walk. Benny Badger doesn't believe him, and so he decides to follow him.

Sure enough, Mr. Fox soon comes across a bird's nest. He tries to take the eggs, but he is so clumsy that he makes a lot of noise and wakes up the mother bird. The bird starts to attack Mr. Fox, and Benny Badger comes to his rescue.

Benny Badger scolds Mr. Fox for trying to rob the bird's nest and then starts to drag him away. Mr. Fox begs Benny Badger to let him go, and Benny finally agrees.

As Mr. Fox is running away, he laughs and tells Benny Badger that he would have tried to rob the nest himself if he hadn't been so clumsy. Benny is surprised by this, and it makes him think.

"I'm only trying to shake the feather off you," Benny told him.  "Don't trouble yourself," said Mr. Fox. "If you'll take those teeth offmy neck, that's all I'll ask of you."  "Not yet!" Benny Badger replied grimly. "You're a robber. And I'm goingto teach you a lesson. . . . You _will_ rob birds' nests, will you?"  To his great surprise, Mr. Fox began
