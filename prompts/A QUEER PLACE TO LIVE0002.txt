Outline: Brownie Beaver lives in a village of beavers that is built in a pond. The houses in the village are all built under water, with doors that lead into a winding hall that goes up into the house. Brownie Beaver's forefathers built the village in this way because they thought it would be safer from enemies. The village has a dam that is used to keep the pond full. The dam is very old and is never finished because the villagers keep making it wider. Brownie Beaver is a young beaver who works on the dam sometimes. The beavers in the village cut down trees and save the bark and branches to eat during winter. Some of the food is stored in the houses and some is fastened under water near the dam. Brownie Beaver thinks his way of living is normal, even though it may seem strange to others.

Story so far:  Farmer Green owns a village near one end of Pleasant Valley, but he seldom visits it because it is a long distance from his house. The villagers there think they can stay as long as they want without being disturbed. Brownie Beaver's great-great-grandfather helped build a dam that was never finished. The villagers kept making it wider, and it had to be kept in repair because bits of it would sometimes wash away. This passage describes a village of beavers who live in houses built in a pond. The beavers are good swimmers and don't mind that their doors are under water.
