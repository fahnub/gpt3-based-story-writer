Last chunk: COME OUT TO PLAY (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)  Girls and boys, come out to play,  The moon doth shine as bright as day;  Leave your supper, and leave your sleep,  And come with your playfellows into the street.  Come with a whoop, come with a call,  Come with a good will or not at all.  Up the ladder and down the wall,  A half-penny roll will serve us all.  You find milk, and I'll find flour,  And we'll have a pudding in half an hour.
