Outline: Cuffy Bear is being chased by bees and he runs to the brook to escape them. He jumps into the pool in the middle of the brook, but the bees follow him and keep stinging him. Cuffy has to keep his head underwater to avoid them, but he gets tired and has to come up for air. He tries to hide in a shallow part of the pool, but the bees find him and keep stinging him. Cuffy stays in the pool until sundown when the bees finally leave. He is very cold and his face feels like it's on fire, but he makes his way home.

Story so far:  Cuffy the rabbit is trying to escape a swarm of bees by jumping into a pool of water. The bees know they will drown if they follow, so they wait in a swarm above the water.

Last chunk: settle on his face again. And Cuffy would  rush off once more as fast as he could go.  At last he came to the brook. And he leaped right off the big boulder  that hung high over the pool and landed _ker-splash!_ right in the  middle of it. How the water did fly in all directions! And Cuffy went  right down out of sight.  Of course, the bees wouldn't go down into the water too. They knew  they'd be drowned if they did. So they lingered in a swarm above the  water. They hovered there in the air
