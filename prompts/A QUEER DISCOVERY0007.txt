Outline: Benny Badger is taking a sun nap when he hears three coyotes talking quietly to each other. He learns they are planning to visit a prairie dog village nearby and Benny is intrigued. He decides to follow them and see for himself if there is really a prairie dog village nearby.

He follows their trail and eventually comes across the village. He sees an owl sitting on a heap of earth and approaches him. The owl tells Benny that he is somebody and that there is no need to dig in the hole since he lives there.

Benny Badger is content to chat with the owl and learn more about the village. He eventually goes on his way, leaving the village and the owl behind.

Story so far:  The coyotes were headed for a prairie dog village just beyond the next rise, which surprised Benny Badger. Benny Badger is tempted to call out to the coyotes to ask if they are really telling the truth, but decides it would be better to wait and see what happens. The owl tells Benny that there is no need to dig a hole, because the owl is somebody and lives there.

Last chunk: Badger,glancing at the hole.  "Do you want to see somebody?" the owl asked. "For if you do, there's noneed of your doing any digging here."  "Why not?" Benny inquired.  "I'm somebody," the owl informed him. "I live here; and I'll bedisgusted if you go to tearing my house to pieces."
