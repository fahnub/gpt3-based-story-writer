Outline: Fatty Coon is a coon who likes to eat squirrels. The squirrels don't like him because he tries to eat them. One night, Fatty Coon climbs a tree in search of a squirrel to eat. He finds a hole in the tree and sticks his paw inside, only to be met with a sharp pain. He pulls his paw out to find that it was a tramp coon who had given him the pain. The tramp coon scolds Fatty and tells him to go home. Fatty goes home and never goes back to that tree again.

Story so far:  Fatty was looking for food and felt something sharp that gave him a dig. He saw that it was a cat's eye. This passage describes the differences between Mrs. Coon, Fatty, and Blackie. Mrs. Coon is bigger than her children, Fatty is rounder than his siblings, and Blackie is Fatty's brother. They all live in the hollow branch of an old tree by a brook in the swamp.

Jimmy Rabbit and his brother have pink-eye and warn Fatty not to come too near them. Fatty asks if it hurts and Jimmy says it does and doesn't. As long as Fatty doesn't touch them, he'll be safe. Dickie Deer Mouse wakes up to the sound of scratching and sees that Fatty Coon is climbing the tree. Farmer Green was fishing in the brook and Fatty Coon reached out and grabbed the make-believe fly on the end of his line. A fable about a coon who plays barber-shop with two rabbits, and then meets them again later. He sees one of the rabbits behind a tree, and the other rabbit's long ears give him away. Fatty Coon is a skilled hunter who takes advantage of the squirrels' blindness at night to catch them.

Last chunk: daytime, for the squirrels to keep out of Fatty's  way, when he wandered through the tree-tops, for the squirrels were much  sprier than Fatty. But at night--ah! that was a very different matter.  For Fatty Coon's eyes were even sharper in the dark than they were in  the daylight; but the poor squirrels were just as blind as you are when  you are safely tucked in bed and the light is put out.
