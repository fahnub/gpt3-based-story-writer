Outline: Kiddie Katydid and Leaper the Locust quarreled over a message that was meant for Mr. Grasshopper. They drew a crowd around them and a stranger who looked like he had travelled a long distance and had a mail-pouch slung over his back asked about the dispute. Kiddie and Leaper explained the quarrel to him and the stranger said that he had the message in his mail-bag but he didn't know which one it was meant for. Leaper the Locust gave a great shout and said that the message was meant for Kiddie Katydid. The stranger gave the message to Kiddie and Leaper the Locust was too late.

Story so far:  Kiddie Katydid and Leaper the Locust quarrel over who the message "for Mr. Grasshopper" is meant for. Kiddie insists it is for Leaper, while Leaper argues that Kiddie should pay more attention when others call her by that name. A stranger arrives with a mail-bag, and upon being asked who has the item in the bag, he replies that he does not know. Leaper the Locust then exclaims that the stranger is a Short-horn. Two insects, Kiddie and Leaper, are arguing. A stranger tells them to stop and mind their own business. Leaper the Locust mistakes Kiddie Katydid for a grasshopper with short horns, and the stranger confirms this mistaken identity. Kiddie Katydid and Leaper the Locust are excited to receive a message, but when Kiddie Katydid jumps for it, he misses and the message ends up in Leaper's hands.

Last chunk: jump for the message. But he was so  eager that he sprang too far. He sailed far over the stranger's head and  landed some distance away.  "Hullo! He doesn't want it!" said the stranger. "It must be for _you_!"  And he shoved the message into Kiddie Katydid's willing hands.  Almost immediately Leaper the Locust jumped back again.  But of course he was too late.
