Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

Story so far: The shaggy man saves Dorothy, Polly, and Button-Bright from the Scoodlers, who wanted to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are two-faced creatures who live in a cave and chase after their prey. They are defeated when the shaggy man throws their heads back into the gulf. The Scoodlers are headless creatures who stumble around on the rocks. Toto tries to roll one of the heads down the hill, but the other Scoodlers pelted him with their own heads until he was forced to drop it. Dorothy is a little girl who is friends with the Scoodlers. The daughter and the shaggy man are captured by the Scoodlers. The Scoodlers demand that they submit, and the captives have no choice but to comply. The Scoodlers led their prisoners to a low mountain of rock with a deep gulf at its edge. Across the gulf was a narrow bridge of rock leading to an opening in the mountain. The prisoners found that the mountain was an immense hollow dome. The Scoodlers are preparing to make soup out of the captives, but the shaggy man offers to go into the kettle first. Button-Bright is more cheerful at this prospect.

Last chunk: he began to cry  again, repeating the protest:  "Don't want to be soup, I don't!"  "Never mind," said the shaggy man, consolingly; "I ought to make enough  soup to feed them all, I'm so big; so I'll ask them to put me in the  kettle first."  "All right," said Button-Bright, more cheerfully.  But the Scoodlers were not ready to make soup yet.  They led the  captives into a house at the farthest side of the cave--a house  somewhat wider than the others.  "Who lives here?" asked the Rainbow's
