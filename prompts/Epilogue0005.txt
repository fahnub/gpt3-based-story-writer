Story so far: The passage describes the final moments of Robin Hood's life. He is on his deathbed, and Little John is taking him to see his cousin, the prioress of the nunnery near Kirklees, in Yorkshire. Robin Hood asks Little John to mark where his arrow lands so that he can be buried there. He dies shortly afterwards. Little John takes three steps forward and hurls a stone mortar at the door, breaking it open. He then runs up the winding stone steps to find his master.
