Outline: In this fable, Peter Mink is a creature who enjoys swimming and spends a lot of time near water sources in Pleasant Valley. One winter day, he decides to take a swim in the brook. Master Meadow Mouse, another creature in the valley, is also aware of Peter Mink's swimming habits and knows that he likes to swim under the ice.

 Master Meadow Mouse is determined to take a cold dip himself, despite the danger of encountering Peter Mink. He is careful, peeking out of his tunnel to look for Peter Mink before he ventures out.

The passage describes how Peter Mink surprises many meadow mice while they are swimming in a brook. The mice seem to enjoy swimming even in winter, and they have created tunnels leading to the brook so they can access it easily.

Even in winter Master Meadow Mouse just _had_ to have his cold dip now  and then. So he ran one of his many snow tunnels to the brook, making a  little opening that led under the ice, where the water had fallen away  and left a cavern. Just because there was skating for Johnnie Green on  top of the brook it mustn't be
