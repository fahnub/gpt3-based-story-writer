Story so far: The passage discusses how Alice and her friend made wine more palatable by adding sugar, and how the speaker and his friends followed the instructions in an advertisement and were successful. Father finds out that the boys have been selling wine and scolds them, but then laughs it off. Dora and the speaker agree to have a teaspoonful each of a new drink, and Dora measures it out. They ask each other what it's like, but Dora can't speak just then. Oswald and his siblings visit Mr. Mallow, who is busy writing a sermon. They are let into his tidy room with a bookcase, pictures, and harmonium. Alice and the narrator meet a lady who is surprised when they offer her wine. She is not young, and is wearing a mantle with beads and a sealskin bag. The beads and seal are coming off in places, revealing bare skin. A stray clergyman asked Eliza if her children would like to come to his Sunday school, and since he was polite and asked nicely, they decided to go and visit him to explain that they wouldn't be able to attend. Alice stands still and says nothing while the butcher speaks to her, looking idiotic in the process. H.O. laughs at her, and is then cuffed by the narrator.

Last chunk: the butcher sat down.  Then Alice stood quite still and said nothing, but she fiddled with  the medicine glass and put the screw of brown paper straight in the  Castilian bottle.  'Will you tell your Pa I'd like a word with him?' the butcher said, when  he got tired of saying nothing.  'He'll be in very soon, I think,' Alice said.  And then she stood still again and said nothing. It was beginning to  look very idiotic of her, and H. O. laughed. I went back and cuffed him  for it quite quietly,
