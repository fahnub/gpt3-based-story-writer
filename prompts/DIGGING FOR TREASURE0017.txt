Outline: Seven friends are digging for treasure in the garden when they suddenly fall into a hidden tunnel. One of the boys, Albert, is buried under the rubble. The others frantically dig him out and he is unharmed but upset. They all share the two half-crowns they find as treasure.

He tells Albert to stow away his things and then asks if he is hurt. Albert says he is not hurt, even though he is a coward and unlucky.

'This promises to be a protracted if agreeable task,' said  Albert-next-door's uncle, rubbing his hands and looking at the hole with  Albert's
