Story so far: The passage describes a discussion between two people, in which one describes a temptation that she resisted. The other person is worried about something, but does not say what it is. Miss Celia is worried that Ben might want to go back to his old life in the circus, but she doesn't think he would actually do it without telling them first. The speaker and Miss Celia's brother offer to forgive and forget the pain that was caused, and Ben shakes their hands. However, he squeezes Thorny's hand with more force, remembering that Thorny had always been good to him. The passage describes a man who is asked to find someone but does not know how to go about it. He is given the keys and told to look in the dressing room. He does not seem to know what to do but is cheered up by the fact that someone is watching him. The speaker is describing a room in which a mystery is taking place, and regretting that her brother is involved in it. She says that the upper drawers in the room hold the key to the mystery, and encourages the reader to investigate them. After Miss Celia's arm heals, she has two maids, two pages, and many neighbors helping her. The passage describes a group of boys who, upon finding a nest of mice, proceed to poke and prod at them in curiosity. Their actions result in the uncovering of a stash of stolen bills. Thorny and Celia discuss a boy who is acting suspiciously and decide to wait and see if he clears himself before they say anything.

Last chunk: asked him  what his flag was at half-mast for, he wouldn't answer. Besides, you  know in the reading this afternoon he didn't listen, and when you asked  what he was thinking about, he colored up and muttered something about  Sanch. I tell you, Celia, it looks bad--very bad," and Thorny shook  his head with a wise air.  "It does, and yet we may be all wrong. Let us wait a little and give the  poor boy a chance to clear himself before we speak. I'd rather lose my  money than suspect him falsely."
