Outline: Mrs. Ladybug sees a frog and is scared. The frog, Mr. Cricket Frog, is also scared of Mrs. Ladybug. They both play dead until Mr. Cricket Frog gathers up the courage to talk to Mrs. Ladybug. He tells her that he would never hurt her and she is pleased. They become friends and Mrs. Ladybug goes on her way, thinking what a brave gentleman Mr. Cricket Frog is.

Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug and Mr. Cricket Frog played dead to avoid being eaten by a predator, but eventually Mrs. Ladybug had to check to see if Mr. Cricket Frog was really dead. When she saw that he was alive, she slowly moved her legs and tried her wings to see if they still worked - and they did. A ladybug is alarmed to see a frog jump into the water, but the frog is just as alarmed to see the ladybug. The frog climbs back out and they both sit down, realizing they were both just scared. Mrs. Ladybug didn't know that the frog she saw was a very timid fellow. His name was Mr. Cricket Frog. He liked to sit on a lily pad and sing. And his singing sounded a good deal like the music that Chirpy Cricket made. In fact, that was the reason for his odd name. Mr. Cricket Frog had a trick not unlike the one that Mrs. Ladybug herself played upon him. Whenever a fish, or any other enemy, came near him, if he hadn't time to hide in the mud at the bottom of the pond, he would pretend to be a cricket and sing. Mrs. Ladybug tells Mr. Cricket Frog that she was afraid of him because he is a frog, but Mr. Cricket Frog explains that he is nothing like Ferdinand Frog and would never hurt her. Mr. Cricket Frog is so timid that when he sees a stranger, he sometimes plays dead. This is what happened when he caught sight of Mrs. Ladybug. Mr. Cricket Frog is a brave gentleman who protects Mrs. Ladybug from danger.

Last chunk: you."  His words pleased Mrs. Ladybug. She said that thereafter she should  always feel safe, with him in the neighborhood.  Mr. Cricket Frog bowed gallantly, with his hand on his heart.  And Mrs. Ladybug went away without guessing that he had himself played  dead because he had been in terror of her.  "What a brave gentleman he is!" Mrs. Ladybug murmured.
