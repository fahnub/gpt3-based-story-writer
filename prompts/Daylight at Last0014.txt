Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

Story so far: The explorers find themselves at the bottom of a deep well with an Ork. The Ork is cheerful, but the humans are dismayed. They all wonder how they will get out. The Ork offers to carry the humans up the well, but they are afraid of falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork escapes the well and is relieved to be in the sunlight again. The Ork tells the humans that he will take them with him when he leaves the cave, and the humans express concern about falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork tells Trot and Cap'n Bill that it can fly out of the shaft using its mechanical propeller tail, and proceeds to do so.

Cap'n Bill and Trot discover that they are on an island after walking through a small forest. The sailor-man and Trot find a light at the end of the tunnel, revealing that they had only made two sharp turns instead of encountering a wall of rock. The old man in the passage hurts himself, and then examines the melon. He decides it is good and gives some to Trot and the Ork. They discover many other melons among the vines.

Last chunk: hurt, and examined  the melon. Then he took his big jackknife from his pocket and cut the  melon open. It was quite ripe and looked delicious; but the old man  tasted it before he permitted Trot to eat any. Deciding it was good he  gave her a big slice and then offered the Ork some. The creature looked  at the fruit somewhat disdainfully, at first, but once he had tasted  its flavor he ate of it as heartily as did the others. Among the vines  they discovered many other melons, and Trot said
