Outline: Sandy Chipmunk is taught by his mother to beware of Grumpy Weasel, a slim, brown creature with a white underside. Sandy catches glimpses of Grumpy twice during his first summer, but is never harmed. The following winter, Sandy sees a slim, white creature headed for the stone wall near his home and assumes it is a stranger. He calls out to the creature, but it does not answer. When it turns around, Sandy realizes it is Grumpy Weasel and runs away. Sandy escapes and Grumpy is unable to find the door to the Chipmunk's burrow. Mrs. Chipmunk blames herself for Sandy's adventure and remembers to tell her son that every fall, Grumpy Weasel changes his summer dress for a winter one.

Story so far:  Sandy Chipmunk talks to a slim gentleman dressed all in white, who is skittish. The gentleman does not answer Sandy. The fable is about a weasel named Grumpy who is feared by many animals in the valley. Sandy Chipmunk's mother teaches him to be aware of Grumpy. Sandy twice sees Grumpy during his first summer but is lucky that Grumpy is not interested in him on either occasion. Sandy the chipmunk didn't see Grumpy Weasel again, and he and his family were all doing well in their winter home. Sometimes Sandy would go out on mild days to enjoy the sunshine. One time, he saw a stranger headed towards the stone wall. Sandy Chipmunk's mother tells him to be on the lookout for a certain animal, and he promises he will.

Last chunk: intent on  chasing somebody or other. And each time that Sandy told his mother  what he had seen, Mrs. Chipmunk said that she hoped it would never  happen again.  "I'm glad that you know what he looks like, anyhow," she added.  "Oh, I'll know him if I see him!" Sandy cried.  "Don't stop for a second look!" his mother warned him.  "I won't!" he promised. "I won't even stop to say, 'How do you do!'"  "I should hope not!" Mrs. Chipmunk said severely.  So Sandy Chipmunk went through his first summer
