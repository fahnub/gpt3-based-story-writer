Outline: Nimble, a young deer, is excited to have finally grown antlers with three points on each. This summer, his fourth, he is now considered a "three-pointer." He aspires to have five-point antlers like his father, and begins practicing mock battles with his friend Dodger. Dodger is quick and agile, often dodging Nimble's attacks at the last second.

One day, they are practicing their mock battles when Nimble's mother interrupts them, scolding them and warning them that someone could get hurt.

Nimble charged more fiercely than ever. And Dodger stood his ground.  With his feet planted firmly beneath him he waited for the blow.  There was a crack and a thud.  "Ha!" Mr. Crow squawked.
