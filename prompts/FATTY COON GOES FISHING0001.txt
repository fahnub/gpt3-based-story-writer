Outline: Fatty Coon is strolling by a brook near his home when he sees a bright yellow and red bug land on the water. He reaches out to grab it, and is surprised when he finds himself being pulled into the water by the bug. He realizes there is a line attached to the bug, and at the other end of the line is a man - Farmer Green.

Farmer Green is just as surprised as Fatty Coon, and he starts to laugh when he realizes he almost caught a coon in his trout net. Fatty Coon is not amused, and he swims to the shore and runs into the bushes. He is relieved when the bug flies out of his mouth and takes the line with it.
