Outline: Mrs. Rabbit's son Jimmy has been gone since early morning, and she is sure he is lost. She hurried through the woods, looking for him everywhere, but she can't find him. She happens to meet Jasper Jay, who tells her he saw Jimmy heading towards the gypsies' camp. Mrs. Rabbit is upset and asks for his help.

Jasper paints a sign that says "Lost, Strayed, or Stolen! A boy in a checkered suit, with a short tail and long ears. He answers to the name of Jimmy Rabbit. A reward will be paid for his return, and no questions asked."

Jimmy is at the gypsies' camp, but he hasn't been stolen. He's just been skulking around, interested in what he sees. He forgets to go home to dinner, but he starts heading home later in the afternoon when he gets hungry. He's surprised to see the sign and decides to hurry home.

Mrs. Rabbit is happy to see him and asks him where he's been, but Jimmy reminds her that the sign said "no questions asked." Mrs. Rabbit realizes Jasper Jay got her into trouble and asks Jimmy what he wants. Jimmy says he would like something to eat. Mrs. Rabbit scolds him and tells him the gypsies didn't give him dinner. Jimmy says they didn't, and Mrs. Rabbit realizes she found out where he was after all, even though she asked no questions.

Story so far:  Jimmy Rabbit is caught by Mrs. Rabbit after spending the day at a gypsy camp. He reminds her that a sign at the camp said "No questions asked" and that a reward would be paid for his return. Mrs. Rabbit gasps twice, realizing that Jasper Jay has gotten her into trouble. Mrs. Rabbit is upset after her son is stolen, and Jasper Jay tells her that the usual thing to do is to offer a reward. He helps her make a sign that says "Lost, Strayed, or Stolen."

Last chunk: have a camp there. And I wouldn't be a bit  surprised if they had stolen him," he added very cheerfully.  When Mrs. Rabbit heard that she was terribly upset.  "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" she cried. "Whatever shall I do?"  "The usual thing," Jasper Jay told her, "is to offer a reward."  "Is that so?" said Mrs. Rabbit. "I've never done anything like that.  Will you help me?"  "Why, certainly!" said Jasper. And he set to work and painted a big  sign, which looked like this:    LOST, STRAYED, OR STOLEN!
