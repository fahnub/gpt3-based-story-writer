Outline: Jennie Junebug is a fat, frolicsome ladybug who loves to eat leaves and play tricks on people. One day, a busybody tells Jennie that Mrs. Ladybug is going to have a talk with her about her eating habits. Jennie laughs and says that she will have fun with Mrs. Ladybug if she tries to talk to her.

Mrs. Ladybug finds Jennie that evening and tries to talk to her about stopping her leaf-eating ways. Jennie interrupts her and starts playing around, knocking Mrs. Ladybug down. Mrs. Ladybug gets angry and tries to speak to Jennie again, but Jennie just keeps playing and knocking her down.

Finally, Mrs. Ladybug gets so angry that she starts to chase Jennie around. Jennie leads her on a merry chase until they come to a pond. Jennie then dives into the pond and Mrs. Ladybug can't follow her. Jennie resurfaces and laughs at Mrs. Ladybug, who is angry and frustrated.

Story so far:  Jennie Junebug is angry at the prospect of having to talk to Mrs. Ladybug, who is known for talking too much. The tale-bearer who told Jennie about Mrs. Ladybug says they only meant for Jennie to enjoy making her keep still, not to hurt her. Jennie Junebug insists she would never hurt Mrs. Ladybug. Ladybug is blown away by a gust of wind and dizzy. Jennie Junebug laughs, then sees Freddie Firefly's light and runs away. Jennie's friend is worried that Jennie will hurt Mrs. Ladybug if she plays with her too roughly. Jennie finds this amusing and laughs.

Last chunk: have Mrs. Ladybug try to speak to me," she chuckled. "If  she does, I'll have fun with her. I'll knock her over. I'll send her  spinning."  Jennie's friend seemed somewhat alarmed at that.  "Now, be careful!" she begged the fat lady. "Don't forget that Mrs.  Ladybug is a little creature! You'll injure her if you're too rough with  her."  "Ho! ho!" laughed Jennie Junebug, and also, "Ha! ha!" She had to stop  and hold her sides, while she rocked back and forth. "This is a great  joke!" Jennie
