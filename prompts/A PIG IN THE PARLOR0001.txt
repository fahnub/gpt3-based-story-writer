Outline: A young child goes to the market in Bonner and meets a pig without a wig. The child is amazed and asks the pig where he got such a beautiful coat.

The pig replies that all pigs are born with beautiful babies and that the child can have one if he wants.

Story so far:  A PIG is a poem about a pig without a wig. Moses Mouse runs up the chimney after Farmer Green's wife appears in the doorway and screams at the sight of Grunty Pig. In the passage, Moses Mouse and Grunty Pig are in Farmer Green's house, and Grunty Pig accidentally tips over a lamp, causing it to break. Moses Mouse tries to hide, but they are both caught by Farmer Green's family. Mrs. Green put Grunty Pig out of the farmhouse because she thought he was responsible for breaking a lamp. Grunty Pig realized that this was his opportunity to escape and ran away. Grunty Pig is in a kitchen and smells something delicious. He finds doughnuts and starts eating them all. The passage tells the story of a pig who is kept out of the farmhouse after he tells tales on Moses Mouse. He eventually stops caring and remains outside. Grunty Pig escapes from his pen and goes to the woodshed, where he finds the door to the kitchen open. He goes inside and looks around, but there is no one there.

Last chunk: A PIG IN THE PARLOR (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    Grunty Pig had got out of his pen and out of the piggery, too. Ever  since his talk with Moses Mouse the day before he had been hoping for a  chance to escape. And shuffling across the farmyard somewhat  heavily--for he was growing longer and taller and fatter every  day--Grunty went straight to the woodshed door. It was open. And he  walked through it. Then he clattered over the woodshed floor and peered  into the kitchen. There was no one there.
