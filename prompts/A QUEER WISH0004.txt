Outline: Timothy Turtle is annoyed when he sees Johnnie Green fishing in his favorite pool in Black Creek. He watches as Johnnie catches three big fish, including the one Timothy was planning to eat for dinner. When Johnnie moves further up the creek, Timothy follows him, complaining to his neighbors along the way.

Peter Mink suggests that Timothy write a letter to Farmer Green, and Timothy agrees, telling Peter to find somebody to write it. When Timothy reaches the spot where Johnnie was fishing, he finds a string of seven pickerel that Johnnie has left there.

Timothy Turtle suddenly changes his mind about sending a letter to Farmer Green. He wishes that Johnnie would come there to fish every day. When Peter Mink meets Timothy the next day, Timothy tells him to go back and tell Mr. Crow that he hopes Johnnie Green will come twice a day to fish until he has caught every fish in Black Creek.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green catches seven pickerel and leaves them for Timothy Turtle. Timothy Turtle changes his mind about Johnnie and decides that he is a kind boy. Timothy Turtle gets angry at Johnnie Green for catching too many fish, and tells his neighbors about it. Peter Mink suggests that Timothy speak to Farmer Green about the issue. Mr. Crow told Peter Mink that he would be willing to pull out one of his quills to use as a pen to write a letter to Farmer Green, but only if it was somebody other than Peter himself. Johnnie Green has moved on again, so Timothy Turtle starts to follow him. Along the way, he finds a quill that could be used as a pen. Timothy Turtle is a skilled fisherman who is annoyed when he finds Johnnie Green fishing in the pool he likes best. On the rare occasion that Timothy catches more than one fish at a time, he captures seven. Timothy does not want to talk to Farmer Green, and suggests that someone write a letter to him instead. He offers to help by telling the messenger where to leave the letter so that Farmer Green will be sure to find it.

Last chunk: not care for Peter's suggestion.  "I've no time to waste talking to Farmer Green," he said. "It seems to  me a letter would be better. Now, if somebody would write a letter, and  get everybody to sign his name to it, and send it down to Farmer Green  by a messenger, I would do my share to help. I would tell the messenger  where to leave the letter so that Farmer Green would be sure to find  it." Timothy then said that he must hurry back to the creek, for he  wanted to see how many fish Johnnie
