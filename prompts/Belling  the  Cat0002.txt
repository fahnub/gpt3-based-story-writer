Outline: The Mice are trying to figure out how to deal with the Cat that keeps killing them. A young Mouse suggests that they put a bell around the Cat's neck, but an old Mouse points out that the problem then becomes who will put the bell around the Cat's neck.

Story so far:  The Mouse said the plan was good, but there was one problem - they didn't know who would put the bell around the Cat's neck. The mice are trying to figure out how to deal with the cat, and a young mouse suggests belling her. The speaker proposes that cats should wear bell around their necks, so that their approach would be forewarned and animals could take cover. The proposal is met with applause from the audience.

Last chunk: that  he  was  sure  must  meet  with  the  approval  of  all.    "If,"  said    he,  "the  Cat  should  wear  around  her  neck  a  little  bell,  every  step  she    took  would  make  it  tinkle;  then,  ever  forewarned  of  her  approach,  we    should  have  time  to  reach  our  holes.    By  this  simple  means  we  should    live  in  safety  and  defy  her  power."  The  speaker  resumed  his  seat  with  a  complacent  air,  and  a  murmur  of    applause  arose  from  the  audience.
