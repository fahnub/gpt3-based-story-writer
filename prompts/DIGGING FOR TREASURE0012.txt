Outline: Seven friends are digging for treasure in the garden when they suddenly fall into a hidden tunnel. One of the boys, Albert, is buried under the rubble. The others frantically dig him out and he is unharmed but upset. They all share the two half-crowns they find as treasure.

Story so far: It is better to be doing something than to be talking, and it is more fun to help others than to think only of ourselves. Albert-next-door's uncle has found two half-crowns in the same place. Dora says she was looking at the spot just before and didn't see them. Albert-next-door's uncle tells the boys that their chances of finding buried treasure are slim, as he has studied the subject extensively and knows that most buried treasure only consists of a single coin. Albert-next-door wants to dig a tunnel and suggests that he go in feet first. We agree and he slowly disappears into the hole until only his head is sticking out. He then tells us to start digging. Dicky went to tell the cook to tell Albert-next-door's uncle that he had been buried by mistake, and to come and help dig him out. The screaming went on while he was gone. The passage describes how a group of children put a boy in a tunnel as punishment, but he refused to go in head first.

Last chunk: You won't notice it being dark in the tunnel  if you shut your eyes tight. We've all been in except Dora--and she  doesn't like worms.'  'I don't like worms neither.' Albert-next-door said this; but we  remembered how he had picked a fat red and black worm up in his fingers  and thrown it at Dora only the day before. So we put him in.  But he would not go in head first, the proper way, and dig with his  hands as we had done, and though Oswald was angry at the time, for he  hates snivellers, yet
