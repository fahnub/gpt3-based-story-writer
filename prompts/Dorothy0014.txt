Outline: Dorothy, Betsy, and Ozma are watching a magic picture that changes scenes and shows events happening all over the world. They see Button-Bright in Jinxland, and Ozma is worried for him because it is a part of her dominions. Dorothy and Betsy decide to go on a journey to meet the Scarecrow and the strangers in Jinxland, and Ozma gives them the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon. On their journey, they have many adventures and meet new friends. They eventually make it to Glinda's palace, where they are welcomed.

Story so far: The passage describes the Woggle-Bug's arrival, the Scarecrow's refusal to let him read his Ode to Ozma, and a girl who is lost and is being led by a man. They come across a boy who is digging a hole. Dorothy meets Button-Bright on a road that winds through green meadows and fields. The Emerald City of Oz is a beautiful and magnificent city that is the center of the Land of Oz. The palace of Ozma is surrounded by a wall of glistening emeralds and is almost a city in itself. The Scarecrow is saved from being burned up by the Orks, and Ozma asks the Wizard to prepare a place for the strangers to sleep. The shaggy man says that every road leads somewhere, so he and Dorothy will eventually find a place if they keep travelling. He doesn't know where they will end up, but they will find out when they get there. Dorothy agrees that the Shaggy Man's plan makes sense. Dorothy has breakfast with Polly and the shaggy man, and they are rejoined by Toto. They hear the sound of a brass band playing, which means that the guests Dorothy invited are arriving. Dorothy is talking to Button Bright, and she is surprised that he does not know anything about sailing, even though he is wearing sailor clothes. She gets angry and tells him that he is stupid. Ozma is the wise and beloved ruler of the Land of Oz. Her best friend is a little Kansas girl named Dorothy, who came to Oz in a very curious manner and has been made a Princess of Oz. Button-Bright is sitting on a throne with the Scarecrow and some beasts. The Scarecrow asks him how he got his name, and he says that his parents always called him that. The Scarecrow asks him where his parents are, and he says that he doesn't know. The passage describes a boy named Button-Bright, who is digging in a persistent fashion. When asked by Dorothy, he replies that his real name is also Button-Bright. Dorothy exclaims that this cannot be a really-truly name. Button-Bright is a lost boy who does not seem to know anything. He is younger than Dorothy and is prettily dressed, as if someone loves him dearly and takes much pains to care for him. The gingerbread man enters the throne room, followed by other guests. All the guests stare at the gingerbread man in surprise. The passage describes the Scarecrow, who is riding on a wooden horse, waving to Dorothy as he approaches the palace. The horse is shod with golden plates and the saddle is richly decorated with jewels. Dorothy is told she will be able to meet the Scarecrow and other strangers at Glinda's palace soon, and she is excited. She goes to tell Betsy and start preparing for the journey. Ozma is the ruler of Oz and is very beautiful, both inside and out. She is kind, sympathetic, and honest, and is loved by all who know her. The Ork and three big birds are landing passengers in Jinxland. Dorothy wonders why the strangers would dare venture into the country, which is ruled by a wicked witch. The Wizard of Oz is a powerful wizard who helps Dorothy and her friends.

Last chunk: famous Wizard of Oz was a quaint little man who inhabited the royal  palace and attended to all the magical things that Ozma wanted done.
