Story so far: The passage describes the meeting of three characters - the Ork, the Bumpy Man, and Button-Bright. The Ork reflects on the question and says that he could carry one of the children on his back, but three adults would be too much. He suggests that they made a mistake in eating the purple berries so soon. The Bumpy Man shovels snow and finds someone buried in it. The shaggy man decides to call the boy Button-Bright, after his mother does. Button-Bright is curious about the Ork's tail, and asks to see how it works. The Ork explains that it is his tail and he reserves the right to whirl it himself. Button-Bright then proposes they go out and fly somewhere so he can see how the tail works. The Ork declines, saying he only flies when he is going somewhere. Button-Bright is digging a hole when the shaggy man comes along and tells him that he should come with them. Toto, who has been watching the boy dig, becomes excited and starts barking. The Ork is scornful of birds, calling them "dreadful creatures" covered in feathers. Trot disagrees, saying she thinks they're beautiful. The Ork gets angry and goes back into the house. Button-Bright tries to catch one of the birds, but it's too strong and nearly carries him away. He lets go and the bird flies back down. The passage describes Cap'n Bill's thoughts on how to solve the problem of the shrinking people. He believes that if the purple berries make anything grow bigger, they could find a way out of their troubles. The others do not understand his speech, and just then a chorus of shrill cries is heard from outside.

Last chunk: Cap'n Bill made no reply to this statement, which showed he did not  fully agree with the little girl; but he fell into deep thought, with  wrinkled brows, and finally he said:  "If those purple berries would make anything grow bigger, whether it'd  eaten the lavender ones or not, I could find a way out of our troubles."  They did not understand this speech and looked at the old sailor as if  expecting him to explain what he meant. But just then a chorus of  shrill cries rose from outside.
