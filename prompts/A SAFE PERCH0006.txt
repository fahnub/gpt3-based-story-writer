Outline: Turkey Proudfoot tries to teach six geese the "stylish strut," but they are too stupid to learn and instead follow him around the farmyard. The other animals on the farm think that the geese are chasing Turkey Proudfoot and start to crow and squawk. Turkey Proudfoot leads the geese to a tree and orders them to stay there, then tells the other animals that he ordered the geese to go for a swim. The hen turkeys and hens start to argue over whether Turkey Proudfoot was running away or leading the geese. Turkey Proudfoot tells them off from his perch in the tree, saying that the geese are too stupid to learn anything and that they'll waddle around for the rest of their lives.

Story so far:  Turkey Proudfoot tries to teach the geese how to strut, but they can't learn it. The hen turkeys tell the hens that the geese were not chasing Turkey Proudfoot, he was trying to teach them to strut. Henrietta Hen tells Turkey Proudfoot that he should be careful because one day the geese will teach him how to waddle.

Last chunk: them,  across the farmyard, to show them the stylish strut. But they couldn't  learn it. They'll waddle to the end of their days."  "There!" cried the hen turkeys to the hens. "You hear what he says. The  geese weren't chasing him. He was trying to teach them to strut."  "Huh!" exclaimed Henrietta Hen, who always spoke her mind right out.  "Turkey Proudfoot had better be careful. Some day those geese will teach  him how to waddle."
