Outline: A black cat sits atop a red chimney in this simple rhyming picture book. As the verse goes on, the cat is joined by four birds, a mouse, and finally a little girl. They all peek down the chimney to see what's cooking, and the book ends with the girl taking a big sniff of the delicious smells coming from inside.

Story so far:  A chimney is black on the inside and red on the outside, with four corners.
