Outline: Trot is dreaming that she is at home in her bed, but she is cold and unable to move. She realizes that she is frozen inside of a block of ice and wakes up. She sees that the mermaid queen, Aquareine, is also frozen and realizes that their enemy, Zog, has frozen them while they slept. Trot decides that the only way to escape is to wait for the queen to melt the ice around them. The queen does so and they are able to swim to Cap'n Bill's room. They find that he is almost frozen and they have to rub him to bring him back to life. The queen and Clia decide that they need to leave the castle and they swim for the opening in the dome. They are followed by scores of sea devils, but they are able to make it through the opening and escape.

Trot decides that she will have to find a way to help them herself.

Last chunk: her  magic wand to accomplish anything. Princess Clia's couch was behind  that of Trot, so the child could not see her, and Cap'n Bill was in  his own room, probably frozen fast in the ice as the others were.  The terrible Zog has surely been very clever in this last attempt to  destroy them. Trot thought it all over, and she decided that  inasmuch as the queen was unable to wave her fairy wand, she could  do nothing to release herself or her friends.  But in this the girl was mistaken.
