Outline: Rusty Wren sees Miss Kitty Cat on top of his cherry tree and realizes she is about to attack his family's nest. He frantically tries to get her to leave, but she is determined to stay. The other birds in the area start to gather and call her names, but they can't get her to leave. Finally, little Mr. Chippy comes and tells Rusty that help is on the way. Miss Kitty Cat is startled by a meow and realizes that the help Mr. Chippy was referring to is a cat. She decides to leave and the birds are saved.

Story so far:  Birds are stuck on top of a house and Mr. Chippy says he knows someone who can help. Rusty Wren scolds Miss Kitty Cat, telling her to get off his roof and out of his cherry tree. Other feathered neighbors arrive and start calling Miss Kitty Cat names. Some of them even fly close to her, as if they're going to peck her eyes out. Miss Kitty starts to look worried, wondering where all these birds live. Miss Kitty Cat is misunderstood by the Wrens, who think she is dangerous. Rusty Wren is relieved to hear his wife's voice coming from the tree, meaning she is safe. A cat is sitting on the roof of a house, remarking to the resident bird that the bird's wife is very shy. The cat says that it has been hoping to get more acquainted with the wife and that's why it climbed up on the roof. The speaker is surprised by the sound of a cat meowing.
