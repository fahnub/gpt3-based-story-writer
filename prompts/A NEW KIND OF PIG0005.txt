Outline: Grunty Pig tumbles through a hole in a fence and is found by old dog Spot, who promises to show him twelve pigs without tails. Grunty is amazed to find that the pigs in the cage have no tails, and he accuses old Spot of trying to trick him. Johnnie Green, the owner of the pigs, comes out and tells them to leave. Grunty and Spot don't see each other for a week, and when they finally meet again, Spot is ashamed of himself for what he did.

Story so far:  Spot the dog leads Grunty Pig to a dozen pigs without tails and tells Grunty that he should ask Farmer Green to be like them. Grunty Pig and old Spot meet and have a conversation in which Grunty Pig asks old Spot why he doesn't have his own tail cut off. Johnnie Green comes out of the woodshed and tells them to get away from his guinea pigs. The old dog Spot tells the protagonist that the pigs they are looking at will never have tails, and that the protagonist should have their own tail cut off since they would be just as happy without one. Grunty turns on Spot, accusing him of lying about the pigs they're looking at. Spot insists they are pigs, and Grunty eventually concedes that they must be very young ones.

Last chunk: all at once Grunty turned angrily upon old dog Spot.  "These aren't pigs!" he squealed. "You needn't think you can fool me.  They're not pigs at all."  "Oh, yes--they are!" Spot insisted. "You didn't suppose that all the  pigs in the world were exactly like your family--did you?"  Grunty didn't know what to say. He looked at the odd little creatures  again. And then he looked at Spot once more.  "If these really are pigs," he faltered, "they must be very, very young.  They're certainly smaller
