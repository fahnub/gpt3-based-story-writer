Outline: A princess announces that she will marry the man who can choose his words the best, and two of the squire's sons set out to win her hand. The brothers are both learned and think they are sure to win, but they are bested by their blockheaded younger brother, Hans. Hans gives the Princess a dead crow, an old wooden shoe, and some mud, which amuses her so much that she chooses him as her husband. The two brothers are furious, but Hans is crowned and lives happily ever after with his new wife.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of Blockhead-Hans and his two brothers, who are all vying for the hand of a princess. Blockhead-Hans is not as learned as his brothers, but he is clever and determined. When he sees them in their Sunday best clothes, he asks where they are going. They tell him they are going to court the princess. Blockhead-Hans wants to get married, but his father won't give him a horse, saying he is not like his brothers. The passage describes a girl who is looking for her brother in a row of people. She finds him, but he has forgotten the dictionary he used to know by heart. The floor creaks and the ceiling is made of glass mirrors, so he sees himself standing on his head. There are reporters and editors by each window, writing down what is said to publish in a newspaper. The passage describes how the suitors were so tightly packed that they could not move their arms, and how this was a good thing because otherwise they would have torn each other apart. The country people were standing around the King's throne in thick masses to see the Princess receive the suitors, and as each suitor came into the room their fine phrases went out like a candle. The Princess said it didn't matter and told them to leave. The passage tells the story of two brothers who want to marry the king's daughter. They both prepare for the wooing process for a week and the one who chooses his words the best will win her hand.

They thought themselves so clever, that if they had  known only half of what they did know, it would have been quite enough.
