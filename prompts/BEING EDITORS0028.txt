Story so far: This passage contains a description of a child's love for drawing on slates and how peppermint can help with arithmetic. It also includes mention of a law that was passed prohibiting the purchase of gunpowder by anyone under the age of thirteen. Finally, the passage describes a trick involving a sixpence and a shilling, in which the sixpence is made to jump on top of the shilling by blowing on the side of a wine glass. The passage describes a boy's experience of working in a newspaper office. He was given five shillings by the editor, and he and his sister Dora both wanted to be editor.

The bushrangers set a guard around the hut, preventing anyone from coming to help.

They had rifled the cellars of the hut, and the rich wines flowed like  water in the golden goblets of Mr Ridgway.  But Annie had made friends with one of the gang, a noble, good-hearted  man who had joined Sam Redfern by mistake, and she had told him to go  and get the police as quickly as possible.  'Ha! ha!' cried Redfern, 'now I am enjoying myself!' He little knew that  his doom was near upon him.
