Outline: The Despot in the East wishes to be known as a very generous prince, so he gives large presents to anyone of note who comes to his court. However, his officers have secret orders to waylay the recipients of his gifts and recover them. In this manner, many people have been both rewarded and plundered.

Once, a wag comes to court and amuses everyone with his drolleries. The King gives him many presents, including a horse. After taking leave of the King and his courtiers, the Wag bundles up the presents and puts them over his shoulders, and mounting the horse, facing the tail, is about to leave. The King asks him why he is acting in that manner.

The Wag replied, "Sire, simply to see if your officers were coming behind, that I may at once hand over the bundle to them and go about my business."

The Despot is abashed at this, and stops giving any more presents, saying, "Giving is but giving in vain, when we give to take again."

Story so far: The Wag is a court jester who is known for his sense of humor. The King is fond of him and gives him many presents, including a horse. However, when the Wag leaves, he mounts the horse backwards, facing the tail. When the King asks him why he is doing this, the Wag replies that he wants to see if the King's officers are following him.
