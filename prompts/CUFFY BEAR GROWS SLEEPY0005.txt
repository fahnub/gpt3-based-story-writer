Outline: It's wintertime and Cuffy Bear and his sister Silkie are excited to play in the snow. They have a blast playing tag and hide-and-seek and somersaults, and they also eat a lot of chestnuts. Cuffy Bear, being the greediest, eats the most and soon gets a pain in his stomach.

Mrs. Bear scolds him and tells him to pick up all the chestnut shells on the floor. Cuffy and Silkie start yawning and before long, they both fall asleep. Mrs. Bear smiles and takes them to their bedchamber, covering them with leaves so they'll be warm. That night, Mrs. Bear and Mr. Bear go to bed early too.

The next day, no one in the family wakes up. They all just sleep and sleep throughout the entire winter.

Story so far:  The passage describes children playing in the snow in winter. Their footprints look like those of barefooted children. They eat a lot of chestnuts. Cuffy Bear's sister Silkie had a birthday party when it first snowed, and Cuffy and Silkie played in the snow every day after that. The passage describes how two bears, Silkie and Cuffy, fall asleep after yawning. Silkie falls asleep before she finishes picking up her shells, and Cuffy falls asleep after he cleans the floor. Mrs. Bear finds them both asleep.

Last chunk: shells they both yawned and yawned. And since Mrs. Bear had  left the room they didn't bother to say "Excuse me!" They were _so_  sleepy! And before little Silkie had finished picking up her shells she  just rolled herself up into a round ball and fell fast asleep. As for  Cuffy, being a little older, he managed to stay awake just long enough  to get the floor all nice and clean. And then _he_ rolled himself into a  ball and _he_ went to sleep, right there on the floor.  So Mrs. Bear found them
