Outline: Jasper Jay is a blue-coated bully who has a problem with people being too quiet. He especially doesn't like Mr. Chippy, a little bird who minds his own business and doesn't make a lot of noise. One day, Jasper decides to fly over to the stone wall where Mr. Chippy lives and tell him what he thinks of him.

Mr. Chippy emerges from the wild grapevine he lives in, and Jasper immediately starts in on him, telling him he's too quiet and needs to be more outgoing and happy. Mr. Chippy tries to please Jasper, but he's so upset that he can only manage a feeble "chip, chip, chip, chip."

Jasper gets angry and threatens to break every bone in Mr. Chippy's body if he doesn't start laughing. Mr. Chippy decides he's had enough, and with one swift movement, he knocks Jasper off the stone wall and back into the grass.

Jasper is furious, but Mr. Chippy has already dived back under the cover of the grapevine and is hiding between the stones. Jasper gives up and flies off, grumbling to himself. As he does, he thinks he hears a peculiar noise coming from the depths of the grapevine. It's Mr. Chippy, chuckling to himself.

Story so far:  Mr. Chippy is a helpful bird who clears the crumbs off Farmer Green's wife's doorstep. Jasper Jay complains that Mr. Chippy is too humble and quiet. Mr. Chippy is happy that Jasper Jay made him happy, even though it was not in the way that Jasper intended. Mr. Chippy is ordered to laugh by Jasper Jay, but refuses because he sees nothing funny. This passage describes how a bully threatens a small bird into trying to make it laugh. The bird is so upset that it can only manage a feeble chirp.

Last chunk: I want you to laugh _loud_.  "You're going to be happy, if I have to break every bone in your body,"  Jasper added.  Naturally, that threat did not help little Mr. Chippy to laugh. Instead,  he looked quite worried. He knew that Jasper Jay was a bully. And there  was no telling what he might do to anyone so small as Mr. Chippy was. So  he tried his best to please Jasper. But he was so upset that he could  manage only a feeble "_Chip, chip, chip, chip!_"  "That'll never do," Jasper told him.
