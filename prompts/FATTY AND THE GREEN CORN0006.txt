Outline: Fatty Coon is out on a midnight stroll with his mother when she tells him she has a surprise for him - something to eat that is the best thing he's ever tasted. Fatty is excited and can't wait to try it.

They come to a field of tall green stalks and Mrs. Coon shows him the long, green ears of corn. Fatty is skeptical at first, but after taking a bite of the sweet, milky kernels he is hooked. He devours ear after ear of corn, until he is finally full.

"And I've no doubt he  was afraid that you would eat up this whole field, once you started."  "I'd like to," said Fatty, with a sigh. "I'd like to eat all the corn in
