Outline: Frisky Squirrel and Uncle Sammy Coon go to Farmer Green's place to steal corn. Frisky climbs into the corn-house through a hole in the wall and begins dropping corn out for Uncle Sammy to pick up. After a while, Frisky peeks out of the hole to see what's taking Uncle Sammy so long, and is surprised to see that he has run away with the bag of corn. Frisky narrowly escapes getting caught by Farmer Green, and decides not to tell his mother about the incident. The next day, he runs into Uncle Sammy again and confronts him about the stolen corn. Uncle Sammy denies taking it, but Frisky doesn't believe him.

Story so far:  Two animals are planning to steal corn from a farmer's storehouse. They will do so by climbing a tree and crawling through a hole in the wall.

Uncle Sammy explains to Frisky Squirrel that he will be doing most of the work in their corn-picking operation, as he will be the one staying outside to collect the corn dropped through a hole in the wall. A boy is upset that he didn't get any corn, and his uncle laughs. The old man tricked Frisky Squirrel into believing that he had gotten corn for them, when really he had just eaten it all himself.

He sees that Uncle Sammy is gone and hurrying up the road with the bag of corn on his back. Frisky Squirrel runs into Uncle Sammy Coon and asks him where his corn is. Uncle Sammy exclaims that he has forgotten all about such a thing.

Last chunk: exactly the opposite direction to that in  which Uncle Sammy had vanished.  He never stopped running until he had reached the woods. And since he  could not bring any corn home with him, he thought that there was  really no sense in telling his mother anything about his adventure.  The next day, as Frisky was playing in a tree-top, he came across  Uncle Sammy Coon sunning himself.  "Where's my corn?" asked Frisky Squirrel.  "Corn!" Uncle Sammy exclaimed, as if he had forgotten all about such a
