Outline: A young girl pleads with her pet cock not to crow before daybreak, promising him a life of luxury if he complies. She promises him a gold comb and silver wings if he will only be quiet. But the cock ignores her pleas and crows loudly, alerting the farmer to the coming day. The girl is disappointed but the cock is content.

Story so far:  A dame has lost her shoe and a master has lost his fiddle-stick, and they both don't know what to do. This passage is a nursery rhyme about a cock that is asked not to crow before day. If it does as it is asked, its comb will be made of gold and its wings will be made of silver. The passage is about the importance of getting up early. The cock crowing in the morning is a sign that it is time to get up and start the day. Those who lie late will never be wise, as it is better to go to bed early and get up early in order to be healthy, wealthy, and wise.
