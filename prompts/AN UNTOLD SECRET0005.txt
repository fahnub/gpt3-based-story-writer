Outline: Billy Woodchuck is excited to hear that Jimmy Rabbit is throwing a party and sets out to find him to ask a question. He runs into Nimble Deer who tells him that he is also invited to the party and is going to help Jimmy with something. Billy is worried that he will be stepped on at the party since Nimble's hooves are sharp, but Nimble reassures him that he is only helping Jimmy and there will be no fighting. The next time Billy sees Jimmy, he asks him what he is going to do to help with the party. Jimmy tells him that he is going to use his horns, but won't say anything else.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow told Billy Woodchuck that he would find Jimmy Rabbit and ask him a question, but only if Billy told him what the question was. Billy Woodchuck is pleased to hear that Jimmy Rabbit has a plan for the party, and wonders if he will be helping by entertaining the guests with a mock battle.

Last chunk: to _help_ Jimmy at the party.  "Ah!" Billy Woodchuck murmured to himself. "That means that Jimmy  Rabbit has a plan. And it must be a good one; for his plans are always  fine."  "What are you going to do to help?" he asked Nimble.  "Jimmy Rabbit didn't tell me," Nimble replied. "Maybe I'm to entertain  the company by having a mock battle with somebody. How would you like to  have a mock battle with me?"  "I shouldn't care for it at all!"  "Well, I dare say _somebody_ would enjoy a sham fight,"
