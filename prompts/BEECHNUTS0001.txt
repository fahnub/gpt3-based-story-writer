Outline: Down the hill from Farmer Green's house, a great beech tree stands beside the road. In the fall, when the nuts are ripe, Johnnie Green, Frisky Squirrel, and Jasper Jay all visit the tree to eat the beechnuts. They all think of the tree as theirs, and nobody else's.

One day in the fall, Grunty Pig wanders down the road and smells the beechnuts. He begins to search for them among the fallen leaves and finds a cluster of them inside a bur that the frost has split open. He eats the sweet nuts, shells and all.

Frisky Squirrel sees him and scolds him, telling him that the beechnuts belong to him, Johnnie Green, and Jasper Jay. Grunty Pig doesn't care and continues to search for more beechnuts.

Jasper Jay arrives and also scolds Grunty Pig. Grunty Pig doesn't listen and continues to search for more beechnuts.

Story so far:  Grunty is upset because Jasper Jay is making her collect acorns, but she reluctantly agrees to do as he says. Grunty Pig finds some nuts that Johnnie Green missed, and wonders why nobody ever told him about the beech tree. Frisky Squirrel tells him it's because he's a pig. The passage describes how Grunty Pig ignored Jasper Jay's arrival and continued looking for beechnuts. Jasper squawked at him and ordered him to stop, but Grunty Pig just grunted in response. In the fall, Johnnie Green, Frisky Squirrel, and Jasper Jay all visit a beech tree to eat the nuts. They each think that the tree belongs to them, and nobody else. One day, when Johnnie is in school, another nut-lover visits the tree.

In the fall, when the nuts were ripe,  Johnnie Green often visited the tree. And so did Frisky Squirrel. And  so, likewise, did that noisy rascal, Jasper Jay. They liked  beechnuts--all three. And somehow they got the notion that the beech  tree belonged to them--and to nobody else.  One fine, crisp fall day when Johnnie Green was in school, a fourth  nut-lover
