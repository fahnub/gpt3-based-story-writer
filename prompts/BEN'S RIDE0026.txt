Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A competition is underway to win a silver arrow. Ben and Bab are two of the best marksmen, but when the old lady catches Ben's jacket and begins questioning him, it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard. A man tells Miss Celia that the dog she is looking for is not a large, curly, white poodle, but a small, black, smooth dog with a short, wagging tail. Benjamin Bat is afraid of touching Freddie Firefly because he is afraid of getting burned. This is because he was once in a forest fire and he nearly got burned then. The passage tells the story of a group of boys who kill a small dog by throwing stones at it. One of the boys, Benjy, feels guilty about the dog's death and goes to the willow tree to think about it. He sees the moon shining down at him and feels better. In the passage, Thorny tries to make Ben feel better by offering him Jack, but Ben is not interested because he does not think Jack is very smart. Thorny says he wishes he had something Ben wanted so he could give it to him. Ben is out looking for Celia on Lita. Thorny is back at the house asleep.

Last chunk: Ben was up like a flash,  tingling all over with a sense of power as he felt the bare back between  his knees, and caught the roll of Lita's eye as she looked round with an  air of satisfaction.  "Hi, there! Mrs. Moss! Something has happened to Miss Celia, and I'm  going to find her. Thorny is asleep; tell him easy, and I'll come back  as soon as I can!"  Then, giving Lita her head, he was off before the startled woman had  time to do more than wring her hands and cry out,--  "Go for the Squire!
