Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

Story so far:  The old sailor tripped on his wooden leg and nearly fell, but managed to catch himself and stand up again. Trot laughed at his antics. The passage describes a room with portraits of sea animals, mirrors on some of the walls, and peony-shaped furniture. There is also a bell cord that Cap'n Bill doesn't know is a bell cord. The General is upset because they are about to lose the battle and be humiliated. Captain Kidd tries to comfort her, saying it's not her fault and blaming Farmer Green instead. Zog has imprisoned the mermaids and Trot in a beautiful golden room. The room has couches for the mermaids to recline on, similar to the ones in their own palaces. The General and Farmer Green are now enemies, and the battle still rages. However, Daddy Longlegs is unharmed and realizes that the ant army cannot reach him. The old sailor man is startled to find out that he has a fish's tail, and not a wooden leg as he had thought. The other sailor man laughs at him. The speaker is happy that his wife has passed away, as she was always scolding him, and he will now receive her life insurance money. He notes that his new boss, Zog, is not a kind person, but he is still better than his wife.

Last chunk: a mighty  good woman with a tongue like a two-edge sword, an' my pore  widder'll get the insurance money an' live happy. As fer me, Bill,  I'm a good deal happier than I was when she kep' scoldin' me from  mornin' to night every minute I was home."  "Is Zog a kind master?" asked Trot.  "I can't say he's kind," replied Cap'n Joe, "for he's as near a  devil as any livin' critter CAN be. He grumbles an' growls in his  soft voice all day, an' hates himself an' everybody else. But I  don't see much
