Outline: Andras Baive is a strong and swift Laplander who lives in Vadso. The people of Vadso are very proud of their champion, and think that he is the best runner in the world. However, they soon hear of another Laplander, Andras Baive, who is said to be even stronger and faster than their own champion.

The bailiff of Vadso challenges Andras to a race, with the stipulation that whoever can jump over an eight-oared boat without touching it with their heel will be the winner. Andras easily wins the race, much to the dismay of the bailiff.

The bailiff decides to get revenge on Andras by challenging him to a race across a fiord. However, Andras is able to use his magic powers to transform himself into a reindeer and easily outrun the bailiff.

The bailiff, who is really a Stalo (ogre), is mortally wounded in the race and asks Andras to promise to give him an honourable burial. Andras agrees, and also agrees to take anything he finds in the bailiff's house.

Andras sails across the fiord in the bailiff's boat and finds the bailiff's dog and son. He kills the dog, as it is known that if a Stalo's dog licks the blood of his dead master, the Stalo will come back to life. Andras takes the bailiff's treasure and gives it to his son before returning home.

He marries a rich wife and they live happily ever after.

Story so far: Two people are betting on who can jump over a boat without touching it. The first person succeeds, but the second person fails. The first person chides the second for their weakness. A horse transforms into a man, and then back into a horse again. The man is on one side of a river, and the Stalo (a creature who is also on the other side of the river) is wondering how the horse will get to her. A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all living things, but not as swift as a Stalo. The bailiff, disguising himself as a Stalo, or ogre, called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras. The mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands, thinking of the new hut that he was. A man in Vadso is said to be faster than the bailiff. No one believes it, but when the man shows up one frosty day, the bailiff is eager to test his speed. The man succeeds in jumping over the boat. Andras and the bailiff are competing in a jumping contest. Andras wins, but the bailiff is not happy about it. Andrashad spends many hours studying magic, and this helps him when he needs to escape from the Stalo music. He turns into a reindeer and gallops for several miles, then stops to listen for the Stalo music. It is getting closer, so he runs again. The protagonist, fleeing from an unknown fear, hears the sound of a pipe and realizes that the bailiff from earlier is behind him. A man finds a treasure and uses it to buy a herd of reindeer and marry a rich wife. They live happily ever after. The Stalo is mortally wounded, and asks Andras to give him an honorable burial and take whatever he finds in his house that belongs to him. He also asks Andras to kill his dog, but spare his son. A small reindeer calf speedily jumped into a river in the middle of which was a stone that was only visible during dry seasons.
