Story so far: The animals are planning to kill the wolf-child Mowgli, but one of the animals, Buldeo, killed a buffalo after mistaking it for the Devil-child. The village plans to torture and burn Messua and her husband for being the child's parents. The animals all agree to go ahead with the plan to destroy the fields of humans. The passage is describing how Mowgli, Gray Brother, and Akela can smell things better than most human beings. Mowgli is envious of their ability. Mowgli stares into the eyes of a tiger until the tiger's eyes drop and its head lowers. Mowgli whispers "Brother" and strokes the tiger's back.

Last chunk: just at the  level of Mowgli's. Once more Mowgli stared, as he had stared at the  rebellious cubs, full into the beryl-green eyes till the red glare  behind their green went out like the light of a lighthouse shut off  twenty miles across the sea; till the eyes dropped, and the big head  with them--dropped lower and lower, and the red rasp of a tongue grated  on Mowgli's instep.  "Brother--Brother--Brother!" the boy whispered, stroking steadily and  lightly from the neck along the heaving back.
