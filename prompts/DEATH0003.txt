Outline: A mother mourns the death of her child. She remembers the child's brief life, and how she will never again see or hear her child. The black bells of death toll as the child is laid to rest. The mother prays that her child is at peace and with Christ's mother in heaven.

Story so far:  The speaker is preparing the body of their deceased loved one for burial. They express how difficult it is to let go, but know that this is the best thing to do. The passage tells the story of how Hugh saved Little Red Riding-Hood from the wolf. The speaker is grateful that it was their loved one who died, and not them. Little Red Riding-Hood is saved by woodman Hugh from a wolf, who was after her. The passage describes how horrible it would be for the speaker to see the person they love die, and how grateful they are that they will not have to bear that burden. The passage describes a funeral procession, and the speaker expresses their hope that the deceased cannot see or hear the bells ringing.

Last chunk: they carry her from here,    The black bells toll and toll.    Oh God! if only she cannot see or hear,    Not hear those ghoul-like bells that crowd so near,    Not see that cold clay hole.
