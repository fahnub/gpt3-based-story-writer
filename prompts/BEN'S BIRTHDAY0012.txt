Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A young boy has a series of encounters with different animals, impressing those around him with his skills. He then goes on a hunting expedition with a group of girls, impressing their hostess. The Muley Cow loses a race to Twinkleheels and is unhappy about it. She thinks Ebenezer is being too nice to him. However, Twinkleheels and Ebenezer become friends and often race in the pasture. The passage describes a boy riding a horse very fast, and Mr. Paine saying that he will break his neck. Miss Celia says that the horse is well-trained and the boy is a good rider, and she falls back on the hay with a groan. The Lion is going to judge Benjy for what he has done. The beasts accuse him of stoning and drowning dogs and hurting and killing cats. Benjy denies killing the cats. The passage describes a man who was beaten for spelling his name wrong. Ben is excited to go get him. The owl is sad because he has to keep digging holes to live in, and he flies off when he sees Benny Badger. Ben is angry with the Italian organ grinder because he lost his dog, Sanch. Miss Celia gives the Italian her address and asks him to let her know if he finds Sanch. Bab and Betty are preparing for a party when they see their friends peeking over the wall at them. Bab scolds them, saying they should be ashamed to be looking before the party is ready.

Last chunk: channel, he asked, pointing to a row of grinning heads  above the wall, "Do you shoot at those?"  Bab and Betty looked up quickly and recognized the familiar faces of  their friends peering down at them, like a choice collection of trophies  or targets.  "I should think you'd be ashamed to peek before the party was ready!"  cried Bab, frowning darkly upon the merry young ladies.  "Miss Celia told us to come before two, and be ready to receive folks,  if she wasn't down," added Betty,
