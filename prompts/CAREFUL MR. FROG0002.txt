Outline: Mr. Ferdinand Frog is a tailor who is visited by Timothy Turtle, who wants him to make a new coat. Mr. Frog is initially reluctant, as he is afraid of Timothy Turtle, who has tried to make a meal of him in the past. However, Timothy Turtle assures him that he only wants a new coat and that he will do something handsome for Mr. Frog in return. Mr. Frog agrees, and Timothy Turtle tells him to come outside so that he can whisper to him. Mr. Frog pretends that he is deaf, so Timothy Turtle tells him that he can read what is carved on his shell. Mr. Frog starts to read it aloud, but Timothy Turtle interrupts him, saying that he doesn't want to hear any more. Timothy Turtle then waddles away, looking very fierce.

Story so far:  Frog and Turtle are arguing over whether or not Frog is present. Frog insists he is not there, while Turtle saw him a moment ago. Frog says he is sick in bed and will become ill if Turtle does not leave.

Last chunk: Frog replied. "I'm not here."  He was an odd chap--this Ferdinand Frog. One never could tell what he  was going to do--or say.  "Yes, you are!" Timothy Turtle insisted. "I saw you only a moment ago."  The tailor then peered out of the window at his caller.  "There you are now!" Timothy shouted, as he caught sight of Mr. Frog. "I  say, let me in!"  "I can't," Mr. Frog answered. "I'm sick a-bed."  "Nonsense!" Timothy cried.  "Well, I expect I'll be ill if you don't go away," the tailor answered.
