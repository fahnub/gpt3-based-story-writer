Outline: Paddy Muskrat and his wife tell the Muley Cow about the dangers of sunstroke, and the Muley Cow tries to stay in the shade for the rest of the day.

The Muley Cow agrees, and when she goes to deliver the message, Turkey Proudfoot gets angry, scolding her for trying to get him into trouble with Tommy Fox.
