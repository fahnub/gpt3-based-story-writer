Outline: Fatty Coon is hiding behind some tall rushes near a creek, hoping to catch a frog. He instead spies Mrs. Turtle and watches as she climbs out of the water, digs a hole in the sand, and then lays a bunch of eggs in it. She covers the eggs back up with sand, splashes back into the creek, and swims away.

As soon as Mrs. Turtle is gone, Fatty Coon trots over to the spot where she was just standing and starts digging in the sand. He quickly discovers the turtle eggs and starts eating them all up. He's happy that he got to eat the delicious eggs, but he knows he's in for it when Mrs. Turtle comes back and finds them all gone.

Story so far:  Fatty Coon is looking for frogs in the creek but doesn't find any. He then sees Mrs. Turtle and forgets all about the frogs. Mrs. Turtle stopped at the edge of the creek and dug a hole in the sand. She then paddled away and scooped sand into the hole she had dug. Fatty Coon finds Mrs. Turtle's secret stash of 27 eggs, which she has left in the sand to hatch. Mrs. Turtle was waddling slowly to the water, smiling as if she was very pleased about something. Fatty Coon was curious and watched her. Once she was out of sight, he trotted down to the edge of the creek and went to the spot where she had dug a hole. He filled it up again, eager to know what she had been doing. Fatty Coon is hiding behind some tall rushes, looking for frogs. He's too young and plump to be very good at catching them, but he's hoping to get lucky. This passage describes how a raccoon ate all of the eggs that were supposed to hatch into turtles.

Last chunk: after a time twenty-seven little turtles would hatch from those  eggs--just as chickens do--and dig their way out of the sand.  But it never happened that way at all. For as soon as he got over his  surprise at seeing them, Fatty Coon began at once to eat those  twenty-seven eggs. They were delicious. And as he finished the last  one he couldn't help thinking how lucky he had been.
