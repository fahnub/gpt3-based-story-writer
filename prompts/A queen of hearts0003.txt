Story so far: The passage describes the speaker's thoughts on her relatives, the family's history with an apple orchard, and the beauty of a morning landscape. The speaker does not understand why everything is settled for people before they are born. The person they are speaking to says that grown-ups often say things that are hard to understand. The speaker then asks what Uncle Roger is like and is told that he is big and jolly but teases people too much. Sara's conscience is always troubling her for doing things she's sure her mother won't approve, but it only spoils her fun. Uncle Roger says that a mother who won't let you do anything, and a conscience that won't let you enjoy anything is an awful combination. The passage describes how every tree in an orchard was planted by someone in the family, and each tree was known by the name of the person it was planted for. The passage describes how the speaker is no longer scared of Sara Ray, but still would not want to be caught by her. The speaker explains that they know why the Awkward Man calls his house Golden Milestone because they have read Longfellow's poems. The passage describes a scene in which two people pause to look at a clock in a hall, before stepping outside into the rapturous night.

Last chunk: not yet begun to beat for the day.  We paused a moment in the hall to look at the big "Grandfather" clock.  It was not going, but it seemed like an old, familiar acquaintance to  us, with the gilt balls on its three peaks; the little dial and pointer  which would indicate the changes of the moon, and the very dent in its  wooden door which father had made when he was a boy, by kicking it in a  fit of naughtiness.  Then we opened the front door and stepped out, rapture swelling in our  bosoms.
