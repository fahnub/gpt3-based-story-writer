Story so far: The animals are planning to kill the wolf-child Mowgli, but one of the animals, Buldeo, killed a buffalo after mistaking it for the Devil-child. The village plans to torture and burn Messua and her husband for being the child's parents. The animals all agree to go ahead with the plan to destroy the fields of humans. The passage is describing how Mowgli, Gray Brother, and Akela can smell things better than most human beings. Mowgli is envious of their ability. Mowgli stares into the eyes of a tiger until the tiger's eyes drop and its head lowers. Mowgli whispers "Brother" and strokes the tiger's back. The passage describes how various animals followed each other in search of food and water. A black panther tells Mowgli that he loves him, but Mowgli does not seem to notice or care. The four cubs run away to play without telling Mowgli, and he calls after them. Gray Brother answers that they are going to roll a skull around before midday.

"I knew men would follow," said Akela triumphantly. "Not for nothing  have I led the Pack."  The four cubs said nothing, but ran down hill on their bellies, melting  into the thorn and under-brush as a mole melts into a lawn.  "Where go ye, and without word?" Mowgli called.  "H'sh! We roll his skull here before mid-day!" Gray Brother answered.
