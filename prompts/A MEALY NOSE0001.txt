Outline: The bays in the barn are annoyed with Twinkleheels the pony because they think he is a lazy loafer who is always eating. Twinkleheels tries to explain that his mealy nose doesn't mean he's been eating meal, but the bays don't believe him.

One day, the bays are forced to walk on the tread mill for thrashing, and they are not happy about it. Twinkleheels tries to talk to them, but the thrashing machine is too loud for them to hear him.

Johnnie Green comes to the field and feeds Twinkleheels some of the newly thrashed oats. The bays see this and they are envious.

One of the bays says to his mate, "That pony has begun to eat up the new oats already. I hoped he'd have the decency to decline them when Johnnie Green offered him a taste."

Story so far:  This passage describes how a group of horses are angry with a pony named Twinkleheels for not helping with the thrashing, and Twinkleheels insists that he would like to help but Farmer Green would never allow it. The speaker's mate groans that the pony "even hinted to Johnnie Green that he'd like some oats." The speaker replies that the pony is "mealy-mouthed as well!" The horses in the stable are annoyed with Twinkleheels, who is always eating something. Yesterday, they saw him eat a potato that Mrs. Green gave him. The bays think that Twinkleheels has been eating meal because he has a mealy nose, but he explains that his nose is just the color of meal and that he hasn't actually been eating it. The bays don't believe him.

Last chunk: A MEALY NOSE (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    It was true, as the bays had said, that Twinkleheels had a mealy nose.  So perhaps it was only natural that they should think he had meal to eat  when they didn't. And he hastened to explain matters to them.  "My mealy nose," he said, "doesn't mean that I've been eating meal. My  nose happens to be the color of meal. All the brushing in the world  wouldn't change it."  The bay pair snorted. It was plain that they didn't believe what  Twinkleheels told them.
