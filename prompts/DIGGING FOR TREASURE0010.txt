Outline: Seven friends are digging for treasure in the garden when they suddenly fall into a hidden tunnel. One of the boys, Albert, is buried under the rubble. The others frantically dig him out and he is unharmed but upset. They all share the two half-crowns they find as treasure.

Story so far: It is better to be doing something than to be talking, and it is more fun to help others than to think only of ourselves.

Last chunk: gets very dirty. But we love our dog,  even when his face wants washing.  'I expect we shall have to make a tunnel,' Oswald said, 'to reach the  rich treasure.' So he jumped into the hole and began to dig at one side.  After that we took it in turns to dig at the tunnel, and Pincher was  most useful in scraping the earth out of the tunnel--he does it with  his back feet when you say 'Rats!' and he digs with his front ones, and  burrows with his nose as well.  At last the tunnel was nearly a yard
