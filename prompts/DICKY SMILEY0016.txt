Outline: Dicky Smiley is an eight-year-old boy with a bright personality. His mother tries to call him Richard, after his father, but he resists and everyone ends up calling him Dicky. His father died in battle when he was very young, so his mother has to take care of him and his two sisters by herself. Dicky is a helpful boy and does whatever he can to make his mother's life easier.

One morning, his mother tells him that she wants to give him a present for being such a good helper. They count the money in his piggy bank and find that he has just enough to buy the toolbox he's been eyeing at the store. Dicky is thrilled and immediately runs out to buy it.

On his way to the store, he meets a little girl named Lola who is crying because her dog has been taken to the pound. Dicky sympathizes with her and agrees to help her get her dog back. They walk to the pound together and find that the dog will cost a dollar to release. Dicky only has 95 cents, so Lola offers to earn the rest by singing for him.

Dicky agrees and they go to the local park to sing. Bruno, Lola's dog, is a big hit with the crowd and they earn the final five cents quickly. They go back to the pound to get Bruno and the pound-man surprises them by giving them the dog for free.

Dicky and Lola are overjoyed and walk home together, Bruno running beside them. When they get back to their respective homes, Dicky's mother is surprised to see him with a dog but is even more proud of him when he tells her the story.

Story so far: A boy is excited to spend his birthday money on a toolbox, and even more excited when he finds that he has enough money without having to spend any of his birthday money. He works hard to save up for six months, and is finally able to buy the toolbox. The passage tells the story of how the boy and his dog found two silver half-dollars. The boy had given one of the half-dollars to a pound-man, but the man was so taken with the boy and his dog that he decided not to take the money. Dicky's mother tried to call him Richard, after his father, but he never responded to that name. Even when she remembered and called him "Richard," his baby sister Dot would cry out, "Mamma, don't scold Dicky." Dicky's father was a blue-coated soldier who marched away and never came back. Lola and Bruno have been sent to America on a ship. Lola's mother used to sing to her when she was a baby, and Lola learned the songs to sing to Bruno when he was a puppy. Dicky earns a dollar and uses it to buy a dog from the pound-man. Dicky has two silver half-dollars in his pocket, which he has been saving up to buy a tool-box. He has forgotten about the tool-box for an hour, but now he remembers it and doesn't want to give up the money.

Last chunk: have"--began Dicky; and then his fingers crept into his  trousers pocket and felt the two silver half-dollars that were to buy  his tool-box. He had forgotten all about that tool-box for an hour, but  how could he--how could he ever give away that precious money which  he had been so long in getting together, five cents at a time? He  remembered the sharp little saw, the stout hammer, the cunning plane,  bright chisel, and shining screw-driver, and his fingers closed round  the money tightly;
