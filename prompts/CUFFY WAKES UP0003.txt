Outline: Mr. and Mrs. Bear and their children, Cuffy and Silkie, live in a cave high up on Blue Mountain. Every winter, they hibernate, sleeping for weeks or months at a time. On the first day of spring, Mr. Bear wakes up and realizes he's very hungry. He goes outside to look for food, and Mrs. Bear wakes up the children, telling them to go outside and play.

Cuffy and Silkie play happily together for a while, but eventually Cuffy loses his temper and hits Silkie. His parents scold him, and he promises to try to be better.

The bears spend the rest of the spring and summer playing, fishing, and gathering food to store up for the next winter. When autumn comes, they say goodbye to the animals who will be hibernating and go back into their cave to sleep.

Once again, winter comes and goes, and spring arrives. Mr. Bear wakes up and goes outside, only to find that Cuffy has been bad again - he's hit Silkie and made her cry. His parents scold him, but he still can't seem to help himself.

The cycle continues year after year, with Cuffy never managing to control his temper despite his good intentions.

Story so far:  Cuffy the Bear is good because he sleeps through the winter like all bears do. Cuffy is a bear who gets angry and hits his sister, Silkie. When his parents hit him, he never learns not to hit Silkie when he gets angry. Cuffy Bear lives with his family in a cave on the side of Blue Mountain. Mr. Bear has been asleep for a long time and is now hungry. He steps outside and sees that it is spring, then goes back in to tell Mrs. Bear. Cuffy Bear is a naughty bear who likes to hit his sister, Silkie. But every winter, he is good for a long time.

Last chunk: his sister. And Mr. Bear and Mrs.  Bear would begin to think that at last Cuffy had been cured of his bad  habit.  "I do believe the child is growing better mannered," Mrs. Bear would say  to her husband, as they watched their son and daughter playing upon the  floor. And then just as likely as not, the first thing they knew Cuffy  would give Silkie a good, hard box on the ear, or a slap right on the  end of her nose.  But for a long time every winter Cuffy was never naughty. You might  think
