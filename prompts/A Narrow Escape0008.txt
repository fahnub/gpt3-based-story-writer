Outline: Jimmy Rabbit is sitting on top of a pile of vegetables in a wheelbarrow, being pushed by Frisky Squirrel. Jimmy is teasing Frisky, telling him that he's not strong enough to push the wheelbarrow. This makes Frisky determined to get the wheelbarrow up the hill to Jimmy's house. He finally makes it and Jimmy hops off. Frisky is so tired, he falls asleep.

The next day, Jimmy asks Billy Woodchuck to push the wheelbarrow for him. Billy does, and Jimmy has a free ride home. This continues for a while, with Jimmy's friends taking turns pushing the wheelbarrow. But eventually, all of Jimmy's friends stop coming around, until the only one left is Fatty Coon.

Jimmy doesn't like Fatty, but he agrees to let him push the wheelbarrow. Fatty is strong and doesn't get tired easily. But after a while, he stops and says he's getting hungry.

Fatty falls over and starts rolling down the hill. Jimmy is glad to be rid of him and runs home with the empty wheelbarrow.

He gave a faint groan and toppled over on the ground. And he  was so fat that he started to roll.  Though he clawed at the grass to stop himself, he rolled faster and
