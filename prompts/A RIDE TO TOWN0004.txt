Outline: Johnnie Green and his new pet lamb, Snowball, become friends. Johnnie's old dog, Spot, is not pleased with the new addition to the family. He tells the Muley Cow that he is jealous of Snowball and that the lamb is stupid.

The Muley Cow tells Spot that Johnnie will eventually grow tired of the lamb and that the other boys will tease him. Sure enough, Johnnie's father takes him to town and Snowball follows. Johnnie has to lift Snowball into the wagon and take him home.

Johnnie is pleased with the whole incident and tells everyone about it. Henrietta Hen tells Snowball to watch out for old dog Spot.

Story so far:  Spot is a dog who is upset because he used to take care of Johnnie Green, who is now a grown man. The Muley Cow listens but does not say anything. Spot, the dog, is not happy with Snowball, the lamb. He thinks Snowball is lazy and won't be able to take care of a baby or protect it from danger. Johnnie Green and his father hitched up the old horse Ebenezer and started for the village, with Spot following them. However, Snowball ended up following them as well. The speaker says that she went to the county fair, and she saw Snowball there. She tells Snowball to get out of the way before Spot comes back. The Muley Cow predicts that Johnnie Green will get tired of his pet lamb and that the other boys will tease him, which will be too much for Johnnie to handle. Old dog Spot hopes that the Muley Cow is wrong, but time will tell.

Just now anybody can see that Johnnie Green is simply crazy  about that silly new pet of his."  It was only a few days later that something happened to cause old dog  Spot to lose all
