The girls in the passage are upset about the possibility of a fire, and beg the Story Girl to stay with them and keep them cheered up. Peter is upset because Roger went to Summerside and he is left alone. Dan and Felix decide to go with him. The Story Girl and Felicity are fighting, and the rest of the group is caught in the middle. The fight is causing tension among the group, and the Story Girl is trying to convince everyone that Felicity is nothing to her. The Story Girl says that if the man they met was trying to hoax them, he would have had a twinkle in his eyes, but she didn't see one. Dan says that if their father was there, he would tell them the truth, but the Story Girl points out that he would only tell them what he thought was true, not what he knew. Felix is scared because he read in the newspaper that the world is going to end tomorrow at 2pm.

"Yes, and if he lets you off then we'll know he was in earnest," chimed  in Cecily. "But if he still says you must go that'll be a sign he  doesn't believe it."
