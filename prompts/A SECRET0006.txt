Outline: Miss Kitty Cat is trying to tell Farmer Green's wife something, but Mrs. Green is too busy to listen. Miss Kitty then tries to get Old Dog Spot to follow her, but he is too afraid of her after she scratches him in the barn. Miss Kitty goes off on her own and does something that only Mrs. Green would understand.

Story so far:  Old dog Spot offers to follow Miss Kitty to the barn, but she scorns him, saying she wouldn't take him where she's going or show him what she wants Mrs. Green to see. Miss Kitty is warning old Spot not to follow her, or she will make him regret it. This is reminiscent of when she first arrived at the farm and he tried to corner her in the barn - she scratched him up pretty badly. The passage describes a cat's relief at getting rid of a pesky woodchuck by sending it away to the pasture. The cat is free to do as it pleases without having to worry about the woodchuck getting in the way.

Last chunk: bother with  you, anyhow. I have a little matter to attend to in the pasture. There's  a Woodchuck up there that's getting too bold."  Then he trotted off, trying to look as important as possible, so that no  one would think he was afraid of Miss Kitty Cat.  "Good!" Miss Kitty cried, as she watched him while he started up the  lane.  "I'm glad he's out of the way. It would be awkward if I had to fight him  while I'm doing what I'm going to do."
