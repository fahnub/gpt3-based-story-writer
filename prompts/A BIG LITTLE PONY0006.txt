Outline: A big, fat potato dreams that he is the king of the garden and has to be obeyed by all the plants. He makes the radishes dance, the cucumbers sing, the cabbages grow, and the pumpkins blue. He strutted and sputtered and thought it was grand to be king and commander o'er all the wide land. But at last he woke up with an awful surprise and found a blind mole kicking sand in his eyes.

Story so far:  The passage describes a vegetable crowd being instructed by a sunflower on how to grow. The bright yellow pumpkins are painted light blue, and the scare-crow is made to buy new clothes. The person in charge is surprised by a blind mole. The passage tells the story of Twinkleheels, a small pony who is determined to keep up with the horses. His friends know that it is not his size that matters, but his spirit.

A big, fat potato lies on a clod in the shade and dreams he is king of the garden with a palace, throne, and crown. All of the plants obey him when he whistles or toots his horn. This passage describes Twinkleheels, a horse who is not lazy and likes to play. Miss Kitty Cat has a poor opinion of him, but Twinkleheels doesn't seem to mind.

And that was the same as saying  that there wasn't anybody any quicker--unless it was Grumpy Weasel  himself.  But Twinkleheels and Miss Kitty were not alike in any other way; for  Twinkleheels was both merry and good-natured. He let Johnnie Green pick  up his feet, one at a time, and clean them. And the worst he ever did  was to give Johnnie a playful nip, just as Johnnie
