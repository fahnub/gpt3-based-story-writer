Outline: Mrs. Ladybug's friends miss her after she goes into the farmhouse to stay for the winter. They spread rumors that she is back, and sure enough, she is. However, she is acting strange and will not answer any questions about her winter stay. Her friends try to get her to tell them what happened, but she refuses. Finally, Buster Bumblebee makes a blundering comment and Mrs. Ladybug finally tells them that she and Mrs. Green did not get along well together.

Story so far:  The neighbors question the woman why she spent only a few days in Farmer Green's house instead of the whole winter.

Last chunk: want them to  ask her a single question as to why she hadn't spent the whole winter,  instead of only a few days of early fall, in Farmer Green's house.  If she thought her neighbors weren't going to question her she was sadly  mistaken.  Only a little while before they had asked her a thousand and one  questions about _where_ she was going to live during the winter. And  now they were all just as curious to know why she had returned. But this  time they asked her a thousand and two questions.
