Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A competition is underway to win a silver arrow. Ben and Bab are two of the best marksmen, but when the old lady catches Ben's jacket and begins questioning him, it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard. The passage describes how Benjy, the only boy in his family, does not play with his two younger sisters. The sisters feel badly about this, and one day they say that they have taken Nox, a big dog, as their brother. The owl tells Benny Badger that he drove a snake away the day before, and looks at him thoughtfully, as if he is planning to attack him. The passage describes a scene in which a group of people are watching a man balance saucers on his chin, nose, and forehead. Mrs. Moss is the only one who speaks, and she exclaims, "That does beat all!"

Last chunk: stood with their mouths open, as if to swallow the plates should  they fall, while Mrs. Moss, with her dish-cloth suspended, watched the  antics of her crockery with a housewife's anxiety.  "That does beat all!" was the only exclamation she had time to make;  for, as if desirous of showing his gratitude in the only way he could,  Ben took clothes-pins from a basket near by, sent several saucers  twirling up, caught them on the pins, balanced the pins on chin, nose,  forehead, and went walking
