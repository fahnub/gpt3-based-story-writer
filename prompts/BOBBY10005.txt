Outline: Bobby Bobolink discovers Timothy Turtle sunning himself in Cedar Swamp and greets him. Bobby begins to sing one of his sprightly songs and Timothy Turtle becomes angry, but he is unable to speak. Bobby continues singing and flying joyously around the swamp and Timothy Turtle tries to call out to him to stop, but Bobby doesn't hear him. Bobby eventually stops singing and wonders why Timothy Turtle didn't ask him to sing more songs. Timothy Turtle has gone into hiding at the bottom of the swamp and Bobby Bobolink can't find him. His friends tell him that Timothy Turtle is just ill-tempered and not actually sick.

Story so far: Bobby Bobolink is talking to Mr. Crow about Timothy Turtle. He says that Timothy is slow to answer and Bobby begins to sing one of his sprightliest songs. Bobby sings for Timothy Turtle and Timothy Turtle feels he has heard enough. Mr. Crow is jealous of Bobby Bobolink because he is a better singer. Mr. Crow is talking to Mr. Red-winged Blackbird about Bobby Bobolink and how he has many names. Mr. Crow is insinuating that Bobby is a rogue.

If Mr. Crow thought anybody but himself liked corn he was sure to be  spiteful towards him. You might have thought, from the way Mr. Crow  acted, that Farmer Green didn't raise enough corn to go around.  "How does it happen," Mr. Crow inquired slyly of Mr. Red-winged  Blackbird, "that your friend Bobby Bobolink has all these names? It  can't be--can it--that he is a rogue
