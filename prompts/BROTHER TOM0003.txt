Outline: Turkey Proudfoot and his brother Tom are turkeys who are forced to spend their Thanksgiving apart. Three days before the holiday, Tom is put in a pen on his farm. Turkey Proudfoot, who has been living on a neighboring farm, comes to visit him the night before Thanksgiving and finds out that he has been miscounting the days.

He then runs over to the fence-rail where the other turkey is.

Last chunk: his eyes when a faint "_Gobble, gobble, gobble_"  from across the cornfield drove all idea of sleep out of his head. He  started up, stretched his long neck as high as he could, and burst forth  with a deafening "_Gobble, gobble, gobble!_" Then he paused and  listened.  The answer soon reached him.
