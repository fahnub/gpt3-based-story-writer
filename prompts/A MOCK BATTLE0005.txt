Outline: Nimble, a young deer, is excited to have finally grown antlers with three points on each. This summer, his fourth, he is now considered a "three-pointer." He aspires to have five-point antlers like his father, and begins practicing mock battles with his friend Dodger. Dodger is quick and agile, often dodging Nimble's attacks at the last second.

One day, they are practicing their mock battles when Nimble's mother interrupts them, scolding them and warning them that someone could get hurt. They pay little heed to her warning and continue practicing when they are suddenly joined by old Mr. Crow. Mr. Crow encourages them to keep going, and they become more aggressive in their mock battle.

At one point, Dodger and Nimble clash in the air and fall to the ground. Mr. Crow is pleased with this more aggressive mock battle, but Nimble and Dodger have both been hurt in the fall. They are quickly scolded by Nimble's mother and told to never mock battle again.

Story so far:  Nimble and Dodger like to play-fight, but their mother warns them that someone could get hurt if they're not careful. Nimble is a young buck who grows three-point antlers. He aspires to have five-point antlers like his father, and begins practicing for mock battles with his friend Dodger. Dodger and Nimble engage in a mock battle, which Mr. Crow approves of. Dodger the Deer and Nimble are getting ready to fight, but Mr. Crow is not impressed with their efforts.

Last chunk: didn't know that the old gentleman was a famous trouble  maker.  So Dodger and Nimble drew a little distance apart, as they always did  when they were getting ready to clash.  "Go it!" squalled Mr. Crow.  And they started. And Mr. Crow jumped up and down in his excitement.  "Now there's going to be some real fun," he muttered.  But Dodger the Deer leaped aside just in time to avoid being hit. And  that didn't please Mr. Crow at all.  "You fellows aren't half trying," he cried impatiently.
