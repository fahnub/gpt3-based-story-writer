Outline: Seven friends are digging for treasure in the garden when they suddenly fall into a hidden tunnel. One of the boys, Albert, is buried under the rubble. The others frantically dig him out and he is unharmed but upset. They all share the two half-crowns they find as treasure.

Story so far: It is better to be doing something than to be talking, and it is more fun to help others than to think only of ourselves. Albert-next-door's uncle has found two half-crowns in the same place. Dora says she was looking at the spot just before and didn't see them.

Last chunk: something. He held it up,  and you will hardly believe it, but it is quite true--it was another  half-crown!  'To think that there should be two!' he said; 'in all my experience of  buried treasure I never heard of such a thing!'  I wish Albert-next-door's uncle would come treasure-seeking with us  regularly; he must have very sharp eyes: for Dora says she was looking  just the minute before at the very place where the second half-crown was  picked up from, and _she_ never saw it.
