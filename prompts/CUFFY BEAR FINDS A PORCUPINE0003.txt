Outline: Cuffy Bear and Silkie are playing in the front yard when Cuffy decides he wants to go to the old tree in the pine woods to play. Silkie reminds him that their mother told them not to go far away, but Cuffy doesn't care and goes anyway. When he gets to the old tree, he finds that it's much smaller than he expected because he's grown taller during the months he spent in sleep. He climbs to the top of the tree and sees a small animal covered in quills moving around in the snow. Cuffy remembers his father telling him never to touch a porcupine because if he does, he'll get his paws stuck full of quills. But he decides to show his father that he's clever enough to kill a porcupine, so he steps close to the porcupine and cuffs it with his paw. The next instant, Cuffy howls in pain and realizes that his paw is full of quills. He starts crying and makes his way home, where his mother has to pull the quills out of his paw. Cuffy never touches a porcupine again.

Cuffy wanted to see what it was. He was always  like that.  Cuffy found a little animal covered with stiff, sharp quills and he knew  that it was a porcupine. And all at once Cuffy felt very hungry. He  remembered that his father had sometimes brought home porcupine meat  and--yes, Cuffy actually smacked his lips! His
