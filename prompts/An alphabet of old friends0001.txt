Story so far:  A little boy cries in the lane. A cock tells him to sell his eggs and buy shoes. The boy then sings a nursery rhyme about a mouse running up a clock. A group of people find a bird's nest with five eggs. They each take one egg, leaving four in the nest. Taffy is a thief who steals a leg of beef and a marrow-bone from the narrator. The narrator goes to Taffy's house, but Taffy is not there. The narrator then goes to Taffy's house again and find Taffy in bed. The narrator takes the marrow-bone and breaks Taffy's head. This passage contains two nursery rhymes. The first is about a tailor who shoots at a crow but misses, hitting his own sow instead. The second is about a black sheep with three bags of wool.
