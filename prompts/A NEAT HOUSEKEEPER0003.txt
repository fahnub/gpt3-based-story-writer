Outline: Rusty Wren's wife is a very neat housekeeper. She cleans the house every day, and is always chirping while she works. Sometimes her voice is sweet and pleasant, but at other times it is not so pleasant. Whenever Rusty hears the second kind of chirp, he is always careful to find some errand that takes him away from home.

Rusty is not so orderly as his wife. Often he scatters things about the house in a very careless fashion. For instance, if he notices a bit of moss or a burr on his coat, he will brush it off and let it fall on the floor.

Rusty sometimes remarks that it is a good thing he doesn't smoke. He knows that his wife would not be pleased if he did.

And then Rusty would smile--but he always took good care not to let  his wife see him.  "Don't worry!" he would say, if she became too stirred up. "I've  never smoked yet--and I never expect to."  One can see that Rusty Wren was somewhat of a tease. And as it  usually happens with people who amuse themselves at the expense of  others, there came
