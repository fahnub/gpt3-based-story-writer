Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

When Benjamin Bat vanishes, Freddie Firefly finds him and they have a conversation. The passage ends with two wanderers being made welcome by a mother and her daughters after they have washed themselves. Ben strokes Duke's nose and Duke nips him. Pat tells Ben to leave Duke alone and Ben says he's not afraid of Duke. Benjamin Bat and Freddie Firefly argue over whether Freddie has become too plump to eat. Benjamin thinks Freddie is plump enough to eat, but Freddie insists that he is not.

"No!" replied Freddie. "But you can't fool me. I know what you meant, as  well as you do."  And straightway Benjamin Bat looked most uncomfortable, because he had  been thinking that Freddie Firefly HAD BECOME PLUMP ENOUGH TO EAT.  Indeed, there was only one thing that kept Benjamin from devouring  Freddie Firefly
