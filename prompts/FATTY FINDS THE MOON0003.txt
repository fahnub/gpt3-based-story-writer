Outline: Wandering through the woods, Fatty Coon's bright eyes catch a strange gleam from something that is shining and glittering out of the green. Fatty hurries to see what the strange thing is and finds that it is the moon! He is so excited that he runs home to tell his mother, and his brother Blackie, and Fluffy and Cutey, his sisters.

Mrs. Coon is puzzles and walks close to the shining moon to examine it. She realizes that it is a trap that has been set by Farmer Green, or his boy, in hopes that one of her family will see it and fall into the trap. Mrs. Coon hurriedly leads her family away from the spot and back home.

Story so far:  The passage describes Fatty Coon's discovery of the moon. He is surprised to see it so close to the ground, but he knows that it often touches the earth. Fatty claims to have found the moon in the woods and Mrs. Coon is skeptical but amused. Fatty finds a trap, and is glad he didn't start playing with it because then he would have gotten caught. Mrs. Coon hurries her family away and Fatty leads them home. The boy in the passage is excited to see the moon and runs home to tell his family.

Last chunk: many a time, resting on the side of Blue  Mountain? One night he had asked his mother if he might go up on the  mountain to play with the moon; but she had only laughed. And here, at  last, was the moon come to him! Fatty was so excited that he ran home as  fast as he could go, to tell his mother, and his brother Blackie, and  Fluffy and Cutey, his sisters.  "Oh! the moon! the moon!" Fatty shouted. He had run so fast that, being  so plump, he was quite out of breath. And that was all he could
