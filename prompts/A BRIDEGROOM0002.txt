Outline: Daddy Longlegs is taken by surprise when he is suddenly visited by a group of his friends, who inform him that they are going to call him by a different name - 'Grandfather Graybeard'. Daddy Longlegs is pleased with his new name, but his friends are soon interrupted by the arrival of a large lady, who is also of Daddy Longlegs' kind. The lady is not pleased with the new name, and she insists that Daddy Longlegs withdraw his consent. Poor Daddy Longlegs is forced to agree, and he follows the lady away. His friends are left confused and bewildered.

Later, little Mrs. Ladybug arrives and explains that Daddy Longlegs has a new wife. Therefore, the 'bride' would not want her husband to be known as 'Grandfather Graybeard'. With this new information, the friends of Daddy Longlegs finally understand the situation and they all go their separate ways.

Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug tells Mr. Chippy that Daddy Longlegs is a much younger person than he appears to be. Mr. Chippy is pleased with himself for coming up with the idea to give three cheers for Grandfather Graybeard, and Daddy Longlegs agrees with him. A lady bustled up to Daddy Longlegs and asked him what was going on. He explained that he had a new name. She doesn't like his new name and tells him to withdraw it. He insists on keeping it and she doesn't understand. Buster Bumblebee and his companions visit Daddy Longlegs to tell him that they are going to call him "Grandfather Graybeard" from now on. Daddy Longlegs is pleased with the new name.

Last chunk: "Goodness!" said Buster Bumblebee. "He looks like a bridegroom!" But  his companions all told him to hush, and not to be disrespectful to his  elders.  "Good morning!" said Mr. Chippy to Daddy Longlegs. "We've come to tell  you some good news. We're going to call you by a different name. And we  hope you'll like it."  "I hope so!" Daddy Longlegs echoed. "What is it, please?"  "It's 'Grandfather Graybeard'!" little Mr. Chippy informed him with an  air of pride.  "Why, that's a beautiful name!"
