Outline: Ben is an orphan who lives with his dog, Sancho. He is taken in by Miss Celia, who treats him like her own son. She promises to never send him back to the orphanage, and he swears loyalty to her. Miss Celia plays the piano to comfort him after he learns of his father's death, and he falls asleep.

Story so far:  The passage describes a woman's reaction to reading two letters. Her face grows sad, and she looks at the happy face of a boy with pity. Ben is upset and Miss Celia tries to comfort him by playing music. Bab is happy to have found a friend in Rand, and is glad that Miss Celia is letting her teach him to ride. Miss Celia tells Ben that his father is not coming back, and Ben reacts with sorrow. Miss Celia offers to let Ben ride one of her horses bareback around her field, and he is excited to do so. He also asks if the book she mentioned before, where the horses talked, is the one he is looking at. The speaker has forgotten to unpack a book, and is reminded by someone else that they have also forgotten to deliver a letter. They are both apologetic and say they will take care of it soon. The speaker talks about a man who went away and may have gone to California. The man never came back and the speaker hopes he is in a better place. The speaker is talking about a boy named Ben who is in danger of being sent back to a difficult home situation. The speaker offers to let him stay and calls him "my boy." Miss Celia stoops to console a crying Ben, who has just received news of his father's death. She reads him a letter explaining the situation, and he promises to be good.

Last chunk: tears, Miss Celia stooped to pat the white head, and  to stroke the black one lying so near it that the dog's breast was the  boy's pillow. Presently the sobbing ceased, and Ben whispered, without  looking up,--  "Tell me all about it; I'll be good."  Then, as kindly as she could, Miss Celia read the brief letter which  told the hard news bluntly; for Mr. Smithers was obliged to confess that  he had known the truth months before, and never told the boy, lest he  should be unfitted for the work
