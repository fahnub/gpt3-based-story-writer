Outline: Dicky Smiley is an eight-year-old boy with a bright personality. His mother tries to call him Richard, after his father, but he resists and everyone ends up calling him Dicky. His father died in battle when he was very young, so his mother has to take care of him and his two sisters by herself. Dicky is a helpful boy and does whatever he can to make his mother's life easier.

One morning, his mother tells him that she wants to give him a present for being such a good helper. They count the money in his piggy bank and find that he has just enough to buy the toolbox he's been eyeing at the store. Dicky is thrilled and immediately runs out to buy it.

On his way to the store, he meets a little girl named Lola who is crying because her dog has been taken to the pound. Dicky sympathizes with her and agrees to help her get her dog back. They walk to the pound together and find that the dog will cost a dollar to release. Dicky only has 95 cents, so Lola offers to earn the rest by singing for him.

Dicky agrees and they go to the local park to sing. Bruno, Lola's dog, is a big hit with the crowd and they earn the final five cents quickly. They go back to the pound to get Bruno and the pound-man surprises them by giving them the dog for free.

Dicky and Lola are overjoyed and walk home together, Bruno running beside them. When they get back to their respective homes, Dicky's mother is surprised to see him with a dog but is even more proud of him when he tells her the story.

The

Story so far: Dicky Smiley is a kind-hearted boy who helps a girl find her lost dog. The two of them then try to sell the dog to a man, but he won't buy it unless they have money. Lola says she doesn't have any money, so the man walks away. The passage describes a mother's love for her children after the death of their father. The mother works hard to provide for her children and tells them that God will help her take care of them. Eight-year-old boy goes to man's door to ask for Lola's little brown dog. Man is gruff and says he doesn't know if he has the dog or not. Boy and girl run home. Lola turns to go home after kissing her new friend and thanking him. Master Dicky, who lost his tool-box, creeps in the back door and tells his mother about it. His mother comforts him. The passage describes a woman who loves her children very much, including a little girl who was given to her by the girl's uncle.

Last chunk: be sure, and a little brown dog too, with a cunning  curly tail turned up in a round bob behind, and two long silky ears  touching the floor. For Dick's mamma had such a big heart that I do  believe it would have held all the children in the world, and as Lola's  uncle didn't care for her the least little bit, he gave her to this  mamma of Dicky's, who grew to love this little girl almost as well as  she loved her own Dicky and Dot and Bess.
