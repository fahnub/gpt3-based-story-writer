Dorothy meets Button-Bright on a road that winds through green meadows and fields. The Emerald City of Oz is a beautiful and magnificent city that is the center of the Land of Oz.

The Scarecrow is saved from being burned up by the Orks, and Ozma asks the Wizard to prepare a place for the strangers to sleep.
