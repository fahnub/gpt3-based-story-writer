Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Kiddie lies low in his tree-top when he knows Benjamin is around, to give him plenty of time to satisfy his hunger. Mrs. Moss tells Ben that he needs to be thinner to do tight-rope walking, juggling, and bareback riding. The horse of Squire was very old and slow, and the kids made fun of it. However, the Squire was very fond of his horse and would never hurt it.

Last chunk: Squire's horse was a joke  all over the town, being about twenty years old, and having a peculiar  gait of his own, lifting his fore-feet very high, with a great show of  speed, though never going out of a jog-trot. The boys used to say he  galloped before and walked behind, and made all sorts of fun of the big,  Roman-nosed beast, who allowed no liberties to be taken with him.
