Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

The Queen wants to make them into soup, but the Shaggy Man politely requests that they be allowed to go their way.
