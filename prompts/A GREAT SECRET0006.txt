Story so far: This passage describes animals with various personality traits. Grunty Pig is gluttonous, Henrietta Hen is vain, Mrs. Jolly Robin is determined, and Benny Badger is unfriendly. Snowball is curious. One thing that distressed Mrs. Pig was that her children would put their fore feet right into the trough when they ate. No matter what she said to them, they didn't seem to care. Mrs. Pig told them that they were being greedy, but it didn't make a difference. Rusty Wren was a tease who liked to make his wife excited about the thought of people smoking tobacco inside her house. He would always say that he never smoked and never would, but one can see that he enjoyed making his wife upset. A new coat made from the twig of a tree is described. Benny Badger is a peaceable creature, but if a dog ever tries to bother him, he will seize the dog with his powerful jaws and hold on tight. When cornered, Benny is fearless and has the strength of a lion. The speaker is preparing the body of their deceased loved one for burial. They express how difficult it is to let go, but know that this is the best thing to do. Henrietta Hen is going to the county fair and taking all her children with her. Johnnie Green admits that Katy did it, and pleads with Kiddie Katydid to be quiet. Kiddie Katydid tells his own people about Johnnie's outburst, and they all agree that it was rude.

Last chunk: night Johnnie Green even thrust his head out of the window and cried  impatiently:  "All right! All right! I admit that Katy did it. And now do please keep  still!"  Of course, his plea failed to silence Kiddie Katydid. But it relieved  Johnnie Green's mind and made him feel better, anyhow.  Kiddie told his own people about Johnnie's outburst. And they all agreed  that it was a rude thing to do.  "Doesn't he know," they asked, "that the night belongs to us?"
