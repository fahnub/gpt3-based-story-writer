Outline: Miss Kitty Cat is perched on top of Rusty Wren's tin house, enjoying herself and teasing the birds, when she suddenly hears a strange catcall. She can't see where it's coming from, but the birds all start warning her about the mysterious stranger. Miss Kitty Cat is determined to find the source of the noise and teach them a lesson, but no matter where she looks, she can't find anyone.

The catcalls continue, moving from one place to another, and Miss Kitty Cat starts to wonder if there's simply a disembodied voice jeering at her. Finally, she comes face to face with the culprit: Mr. Catbird, who has been imitating a cat to tease her. The other birds all join in, making so much noise that Miss Kitty Cat retreats to the haymow to get away from them.

Story so far:  The birds are excited because a strange, mocking cat has arrived, and Miss Kitty Cat is angry. She challenges the cat to a fight.

Last chunk: Meanwhile the birds were all exclaiming, "There! He's here. Now Miss  Kitty Cat had better watch out."  Again a strange, mocking catcall sounded from somewhere. There was a  sort of jeer about it that aroused Miss Kitty Cat's anger.  "He's come, has he?" she exclaimed to little Mr. Chippy, who chattered  at her from a good, safe distance. "If he's looking for a fight I'd be  pleased to have him come and get it."  Whoever the stranger was, and wherever he was, he knew how to tease Miss  Kitty
