Outline: It's wintertime and Cuffy Bear and his sister Silkie are excited to play in the snow. They have a blast playing tag and hide-and-seek and somersaults, and they also eat a lot of chestnuts. Cuffy Bear, being the greediest, eats the most and soon gets a pain in his stomach.

Mrs. Bear scolds him and tells him to pick up all the chestnut shells on the floor. Cuffy and Silkie start yawning and before long, they both fall asleep. Mrs. Bear smiles and takes them to their bedchamber, covering them with leaves so they'll be warm. That night, Mrs. Bear and Mr. Bear go to bed early too.

Story so far:  The passage describes children playing in the snow in winter. Their footprints look like those of barefooted children. They eat a lot of chestnuts.

Mrs. Bear tells Cuffy and Silkie to go to bed, and says she doesn't want the chestnut shells lying on the floor all winter.

Last chunk: both of you."  Cuffy yawned.  "What do you say?" Mrs. Bear asked severely.  "Excuse me!" Cuffy said hastily.  "That's better!" said Mrs. Bear. "Now do as I say. You'll be asleep  before you know it. And I don't intend to have those chestnut shells  lying on the floor all winter."  You may think that that was a queer thing for Mrs. Bear to say. But when  you see what happened, you'll understand what Mrs. Bear meant.  As Cuffy and Silkie sat down on the floor and began gathering up the  chestnut-
