Outline: Once upon a time, the animals got tired of Brer Rabbit's antics and decided to hold a convention to stop him. Brer Fox offered a pot of gold to the creature who could catch Brer Rabbit, and Brer Buzzard said he would try. The other animals agreed, and Brer Rabbit was soon sent for to attend the convention.

Old friend Wobble-nose knew what was going on and warned Brer Rabbit. Brer Rabbit pretended he wanted to learn how to fly, and Brer Buzzard agreed to give him a ride. Brer Rabbit jumped on Brer Buzzard's back and they took off into the sky.

Brer Rabbit had a paw under each of Brer Buzzard's wings and when Brer Buzzard tried to drop him, he would scratch and tickle him. The other animals watched from below, waiting for Brer Rabbit to fall.

After a while, Brer Rabbit got tired of riding and steered Brer Buzzard back down to the ground. He then went into hiding, and when the other animals came looking for him, he was nowhere to be found. And that, as they say, is that.

Story so far: Brer Rabbit is hosting a race on a hot summer day. A storm blows in, and the child who was playing nearby runs to take shelter with Uncle Remus. Brer Rabbit and the partridge nest is a fable about two animals who are having a conversation. The Whipperwill is crying on the hill, and the Bob White is choking herself with saying Good-night. The two animals know that something is wrong, and they believe that the Whipperwill and the Bob White are telling a sad tale. Brer Rabbit is planning to fish, and he tells all the animals about it. They all say they'll be there to help, and he leaves them wishing they could come. Brer Coon and Brer Fox discuss how to get the moon out of the pond after it falls in. They decide to drag it out with a seine, but when it comes to actually doing the work, they start to argue. Brer Rabbit and Brer Fox have a bet where Brer Rabbit tries to get a horse from a pasture and Brer Fox tries to stop him. Brer Rabbit gets the horse and Brer Fox doesn't.
