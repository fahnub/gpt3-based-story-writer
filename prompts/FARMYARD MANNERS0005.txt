Outline: Turkey Proudfoot asks Simon Screecher, a bird, to deliver a message to his cousin Solomon Owl to meet him in the woods tomorrow night. Simon agrees and flies off. A short while later, Turkey hears Solomon laughing and assumes he is laughing at the message. When Simon returns, Turkey demands to know what the joke is. Simon explains that Solomon thinks Turkey is a tough old bird and doesn't want to bother with him. Turkey gets angry and tells Simon to go away. Simon starts to leave, but Turkey stops him and tells him to stay awhile longer. They both become sleepy and soon realize it is dawn. Turkey hurries home to the farmyard to get breakfast.

Story so far:  Turkey Proudfoot and Simon Screecher argue about who has it worse, turkeys sleeping in the woods or Simon Screecher sleeping in the farmyard. Turkey Proudfoot asks Simon Screecher to tell his cousin Solomon Owl to meet him in a clearing in the woods tomorrow night. When Simon Screecher leaves, Turkey hears Solomon Owl laughing and wonders what the joke is. Turkey Proudfoot and Simon Screecher are both feeling sleepy and decide to head home. As they part ways, they both hear the sound of a shotgun being fired. The passage describes a squirrel's preparations for breakfast as the sun begins to rise. The squirrel drops out of an oak tree and hurries home, eager to eat the large breakfast that Farmer Green always provides in the fall. Simon Screecher is walking home when he mutters about how his cousin Solomon, who is a mouse, ate two mice, three frogs, four spiders, and five grasshoppers earlier that night. He reflects that if Solomon had been hungry, he would have been in a terrible mood and would have fought Turkey Proudfoot, who narrowly escaped. Turkey Proudfoot becomes angry when Simon Screecher corrects him, telling Screecher to go away.

Last chunk: It was a  crow. It was the rooster's crow, way down at the farmyard.  "Why, it's almost dawn!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed. "I didn't know the  night was so nearly gone. It's no wonder I couldn't sleep. The dawn of  another day always makes one wide awake."  "It always makes one sleepy, you mean," Simon Screecher corrected him.  Now, Turkey Proudfoot always grew angry when anybody corrected him in  any way. And he flew into a rage.  "Go away! Go home!" he spluttered. "I don't enjoy your company."
