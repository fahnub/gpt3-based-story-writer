When Jimmy starts boasting about his speed, Tommy challenges him to a race from the creek to Broad Brook.

The next day, Jimmy Rabbit meets Mr. Turtle at the creek and they start off on the race. Jimmy Rabbit is confident he will win, but Mr. Turtle gradually starts to pull ahead. As they near the finish line, Jimmy Rabbit pushes himself to the limit and barely crosses the finish line first.

And if she heard you mention such a thing to me she  would be very angry."  "I didn't mean to say that," Mr. Turtle told him hastily. "It was just a  slip of the tongue. What I meant to say was this: If you win the race,  I'll _give_ you a fine new sled; and if I win, you can _give_ me your  wheelbarrow."  Jimmy
