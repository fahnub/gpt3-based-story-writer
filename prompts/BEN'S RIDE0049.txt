Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A competition is underway to win a silver arrow. Ben and Bab are two of the best marksmen, but when the old lady catches Ben's jacket and begins questioning him, it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend.

A man tells Miss Celia that the dog she is looking for is not a large, curly, white poodle, but a small, black, smooth dog with a short, wagging tail. Benjamin Bat is afraid of touching Freddie Firefly because he is afraid of getting burned. This is because he was once in a forest fire and he nearly got burned then. The passage tells the story of a group of boys who kill a small dog by throwing stones at it. One of the boys, Benjy, feels guilty about the dog's death and goes to the willow tree to think about it. He sees the moon shining down at him and feels better. In the passage, Thorny tries to make Ben feel better by offering him Jack, but Ben is not interested because he does not think Jack is very smart. Thorny says he wishes he had something Ben wanted so he could give it to him. Ben is out looking for Celia on Lita. Thorny is back at the house asleep. The passage is about a boy who finds his mother and groom in the barn, and wonders why they are there. Ben and Lita are lying down together, with Lita's head in Ben's lap. Thorny is watching them and admiringly comments that they look like the "fellow that brought the good news from Ghent to Aix" (referencing a poem). Ben asks Thorny what the next line of the poem is, and Thorny recites it.

Last chunk: didn't we, my beauty?" and Ben  chuckled as he took Lita's head in his lap, while she answered with a  gusty sigh that nearly blew him away.  "Like the fellow that brought the good news from Ghent to Aix," said  Thorny, surveying the recumbent pair with great admiration.  "What follow?" asked Ben, wondering if he didn't mean Sheridan, of whose  ride he had heard.  "Don't you know that piece? I spoke it at school. Give it to you now;  see if it isn't a rouser."
