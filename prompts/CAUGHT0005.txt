Outline: Johnnie Green sees Mr. Turtle and chases after him. He catches up to Mr. Turtle and traps him with a stick. Johnnie Green is unsure of what to do with Mr. Turtle, but he eventually decides to flip him over on his back. Johnnie Green leaves Mr. Turtle there, unable to move. Mr. Crow arrives and hears Timothy's remarks.

Story so far:  Freddie Firefly goes to the Bumblebee family home in the meadow to get nectar and promises to bring a fellow worker back with him. Mr. Crow plans to go out in the rain without an umbrella, against Jasper Jay's advice. Jasper offers to help by holding Mr. Crow's umbrella, but Mr. Crow refuses. Johnnie is considering carving his initials into Mr. Turtle's shell, but he is hesitant because the turtle looks fierce up close and has a strong grip on the stick. Johnnie imagines how unpleasant it would be to have the turtle attached to his body, and decides against it. Old Mr. Crow is in a hurry to leave a crows' meeting because it starts raining, and he doesn't want anybody else to use his umbrella for the first time. Crow was not good at arithmetic and was sitting in a pine looking across a cornfield when he saw a small bird disappear into a giant's head. He exclaimed that the bird must have been eaten, but then the bird reappeared and flew away. Old Mr. Crow knew that if the bird could survive inside the giant's head, then he could too. Mr. Crow is angry at Jasper Jay for stealing his umbrella and taking shelter under it. Jasper Jay is sitting at the top of a tree in the rain, enjoying himself while Mr. Crow, who's umbrella he's using, is not. Johnnie Green turns Timothy Turtle over on his back, upsetting him in the process. He then leaves him there, unable to move.

Last chunk: Green saw that that plan wouldn't do at all. But he turned  Timothy over, just for fun, upsetting him neatly by lifting him on the  stick--for Timothy had not sense enough to let go of it in time to save  himself.  Johnnie stayed there only long enough to make sure that Timothy Turtle  was unable to move. And he soon decided that the savage old rascal would  have to lie on his back until somebody came along and tipped him over.  Then Johnnie Green scampered away.  To be sure, Mr. Turtle wriggled
