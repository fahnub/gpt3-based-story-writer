Outline: Rusty Wren's wife is a very neat housekeeper. She cleans the house every day, and is always chirping while she works. Sometimes her voice is sweet and pleasant, but at other times it is not so pleasant. Whenever Rusty hears the second kind of chirp, he is always careful to find some errand that takes him away from home.

Rusty is not so orderly as his wife. Often he scatters things about the house in a very careless fashion. For instance, if he notices a bit of moss or a burr on his coat, he will brush it off and let it fall on the floor. And when Mrs. Rusty finds anything like that in her cottage, she always knows how it got there.

Rusty sometimes remarks that it is a good thing he doesn't smoke. He knows that his wife would not be pleased if he did.

One day, after Rusty has come home from an excursion to the pasture, Mrs. Rusty begins sniffing the air. She looks at her husband suspiciously and says that she believes he has been smoking. Rusty begins to fidget and says that it must be the smoke of a pine stump that she notices. But Mrs. Rusty is not convinced and continues to scold him.

Just then, Rusty notices a bit of something clinging to one of his tail feathers. Without thinking, he flicked it onto the floor. When Mrs. Rusty sees it, she is even more sure that her husband has been smoking. She screams at him that it is tobacco, and Rusty knows that he is in trouble.

He would always say that he never smoked and never would, but one can see that he enjoyed making his wife upset. A man finds a scrap of tobacco and is confronted by his wife, who screams at him. Rusty is scolded by his wife for smoking, but insists that the smoke is coming from a pine stump. Mr. Rusty Wren is scolded by his wife for flicking a tiny scrap on the floor without thinking. A wren's wife was a neat housekeeper and whenever her voice wasn't pleasant, her husband knew to leave the house. Rusty is a very messy person, and his wife always has to clean up after him. He once asked her how she would feel if he left tobacco and ashes around for her to pick up.

Last chunk: house in a very careless fashion.  For instance, if he happened to notice a bit of moss--or a  burr--clinging to his coat, just as likely as not he would brush it  off and let it fall upon the floor. And when Mrs. Rusty found  anything like that in her cottage, she always knew how it came  there.  Rusty sometimes remarked that it was a good thing he didn't smoke.  "How would you like it if I dropped bits of tobacco, or ashes, and  maybe burnt matches for you to pick up?" he asked his wife.  "You
