Story so far: The passage tells the story of two boys who make peace with each other after a fight. However, their peace doesn't last long, as one of the boys soon starts tormenting the other again. The passage also describes the plans of three siblings after they return from their travels. Elidyr grows tired of games and play and becomes homesick.

He decides to go home, but on the way he meets two elves who give him a better option.

The passage describes the many historical sites in Wales, and how they are still inhabited by animals and plants. The boy in the passage is being chased by some small men, but he manages to get to the cottage door first and escape. However, he then stumbles over the threshold and drops the ball he was carrying.

Roosting  here, Sam began to shout for aid
