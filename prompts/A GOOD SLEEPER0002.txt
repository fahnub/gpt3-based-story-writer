Outline: Twinkleheels is a young horse who is annoyed with his neighbor, Ebenezer, an old horse who is always falling asleep. Twinkleheels is determined to teach Ebenezer a lesson by racing him and showing him how fast he can go. However, Ebenezer is a very experienced horse and easily defeats Twinkleheels. Afterwards, Ebenezer explains to Twinkleheels that he is successful because he always pays attention and mind his own business - something that Twinkleheels still has to learn.

Story so far:  Twinkleheels is talking to Ebenezer. Twinkleheels is always quick and Ebenezer is always slow. Johnnie Green used to think it was funny to drive or ride Ebenezer, but now he pays little attention.

Last chunk: Twinkleheels was talking to him.  Twinkleheels always moved smartly. Ebenezer took his time about  everything. When anybody backed him between the thills of a wagon he was  as slow as Timothy Turtle and no more graceful. And while people  harnessed him he usually sighed heavily now and then, because he dreaded  being hurried along the road.  Before Twinkleheels came to the farm to live, Johnnie Green had thought  it quite a lark to drive or ride Ebenezer. Now, however, Johnnie paid  little heed
