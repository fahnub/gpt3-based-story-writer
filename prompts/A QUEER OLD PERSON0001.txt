Outline: Grandfather Mole is a queer old creature who lives in Farmer Green's garden. He is mostly blind and has very small ears, but he is a great digger and has made himself a large home underground. He mostly eats angleworms, which he finds by burrowing through the soil, but he is content to eat any grubs or worms he finds. He is happy with his life and only ever complains about the scarcity of angleworms.

Story so far:  Grandfather Mole was an odd person whose neighbors said he had no ears. Grandfather Mole himself sometimes remarked that he didn't know how he could have burrowed as he did if he had been forever getting dirt in his eyes and ears. He seemed quite satisfied to be just as he was. Grandfather Mole was contented with his lot, except for the scarcity of angleworms. Mole is able to tunnel underground easily and efficiently due to his long nose and spade-like feet, and he is never bothered by his fur when he is tunneling. Grandfather Mole had dug many halls beneath the surface of the garden for a certain purpose. Through them, he could make his way in the darkness. Grandfather Mole was blind but had a good sense of smell and a huge appetite. He would go on underground strolls and find angleworms to eat. Grandfather Mole is a queer old person who lives in Farmer Green's garden. He is seldom seen because he spends most of his time underground.
