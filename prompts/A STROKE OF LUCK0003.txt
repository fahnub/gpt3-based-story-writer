Outline: The story follows Jasper Jay and his friends as they tease and mock Solomon Owl. Solomon Owl is a big, strong owl who is usually very polite to people, but the blue jays know that they can tease him because he won't hurt them. Noisy Jake takes credit for finding Solomon Owl even though Jasper Jay was the one who actually spotted him. Jasper Jay decides to keep quiet and have fun teasing Solomon Owl without letting him know that Jasper is there. People believe that Solomon Owl can't see in the daytime, but he is actually just very still and quiet. Solomon Owl is thinking deeply during the whole ordeal. At the end, Jasper Jay is the only one who knows that Solomon Owl is wise as well as strong.

Story so far:  This passage describes Jasper's plan to tease Solomon Owl by remaining silent while Jake talks loudly.

Jasper is sulky because it was originally his party. Noisy Jake asked Solomon Owl if he was going to kill any chickens this fall. Jasper Jay was amusing himself by dropping hemlock seeds on Solomon's head.

Jasper Jay was not aware of that. The blue jays like to tease Solomon Owl, but they know not to get too close to his sharp talons and hooked beak.

Last chunk: there  was nothing they liked better than teasing Solomon Owl--when there were  enough of them. In case any of the blue-coated rascals met Mr. Owl  alone, he was most polite to him, for Solomon was not only big and  strong but he had sharp talons and a hooked beak.  Those thirteen blue jays, however, knew that they had little to fear  from the solemn old chap, so long as they kept out of reach of his  claws.  They began jeering at Solomon Owl. And some of them even tried to mock  his queer cry,
