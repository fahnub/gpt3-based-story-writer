Outline: Snowball, a sheep, is knocked down by a black ram and decides he must be sheared. He goes to the pasture to find his old companions, but they are so changed by shearing that he can't tell who is who. He grins at them, and the big old dame scolds him, telling him he will be sheared too. Farmer Green comes in and Johnnie Green says he wants to shear Snowball himself.

Not until she spoke did Snowball guess that this person was Aunt Nancy  Ewe. The moment he heard her voice he knew her. And he couldn't help  laughing right in her face.  "Don't be rude, young man!" Aunt Nancy scolded. "Anybody would think you  had never seen a sheared flock before."  "I haven't," Snowball answered. "You're all so
