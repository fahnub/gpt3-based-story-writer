Outline: Dorothy, the shaggy man, Toto, and Button-Bright are taken prisoner by foxes and led to the royal palace. The fox king questions them and is pleased to learn they are friends. The king tells Dorothy that everyone knows who she is and that she is an important personage since Princess Ozma of Oz made her her friend. The king also reveals that Ozma is going to celebrate her birthday on the twenty-first of the month and expresses his hope to get an invitation.

Dorothy is surprised to learn that they are not in Kansas anymore and that they have been transported to Foxville in Fairyland. The fox king tells her that she can return to Kansas if she wishes, but Dorothy decides to stay and explore Foxville instead.

Story so far:  The shaggy man tells Dorothy that the fox's name is Button-Bright. The fox-king and his court are described as being very grand and stately. They are seated in a large, ornate room with stained glass windows. All of the foxes are wearing spectacles, which makes them look serious and important. Dorothy recognizes the King because she has seen his head carving on the archway. The passage describes how an hour or two could bring someone from Oz to Foxville, which is nearer to Oz than it is to Kansas. Dorothy is surprised to learn that this is possible and wonders if she is going on another fairy adventure. The shaggy man, Dorothy, and Button-Bright are ordered by the fox-captain to pound a drum with their knees. Toto is left out and barked when Dorothy pounded the drum for him.

Last chunk: what I do," ordered the captain; so the shaggy  man pounded the drum with his knees, and so did Dorothy and so did  Button-Bright.  The boy wanted to keep on pounding it with his little  fat knees, because he liked the sound of it; but the captain stopped  him.  Toto couldn't pound the drum with his knees and he didn't know  enough to wag his tail against it, so Dorothy pounded the drum for him  and that made him bark, and when the little dog barked the fox-captain  scowled.
