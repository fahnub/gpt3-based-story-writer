Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

Story so far:  The explorers find a melon on the ground and are delighted. The Ork offers to carry Trot and Cap'n Bill up the well, with Trot sitting on its shoulders and Cap'n Bill grabbing hold of its legs. The Ork is spinning Trot and Cap'n Bill around in the air, and they are both clinging to the Ork for dear life. A house has been built at the edge of the forest, and the speaker and Trot are going to see if anyone is living there. The Ork escapes the well and is relieved to be in the sunlight again.

There were plenty of trees and flowers, but no houses or paths. The Ork thought he saw the ocean, and when they went to the top of a nearby hill, they could see it.

Last chunk: there were,  in plenty, and shrubs and flowers and green turf. But there were no  houses; there were no paths; there was no sign of civilization whatever.  "Just before I settled down on the ground I thought I caught a view of  the ocean," said the Ork. "Let's see if I was right." Then he flew to a  little hill, near by, and Trot and Cap'n Bill followed him more slowly.
