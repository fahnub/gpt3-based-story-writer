Outline: Cuffy Bear has gone into a cave to hibernate for the winter and Nimble the rabbit has promised to wait for him outside. When Cuffy doesn't come out after several hours, Nimble begins to worry and goes in search of help. He first asks Peter Mink, but Peter is uninterested and won't help. Nimble then finds Mr. Grouse, who tells him that Cuffy is most likely in a deep sleep and won't wake up until spring. Nimble decides to go to Cedar Swamp to get Fatty Coon, who is known for being a good tracker. hopefully he can find Cuffy before he wakes up in the spring.

Story so far:  Nimble has asked Peter Mink to go into a cave to fetch Cuffy the Bear, but Peter is unwilling, suspecting that Nimble is trying to trick him. Nimble explains that the snow has covered any tracks that Cuffy might have left, and points out that he himself is too tall to fit into the cave. Nimble has been left alone with Cuffy Bear, who is injured. He wants to send Peter Mink for help, but Peter says he has to go home.

He felt that he ought to go for  help, somewhere. But he had promised Cuffy Bear to wait for him.  Then all at once an idea came to him. Why not send Peter Mink for help?  "Won't you please go down to Cedar Swamp and ask Fatty Coon to come up  here?" Nimble begged Peter.  "I can't," Peter answered. "I must go home now."
