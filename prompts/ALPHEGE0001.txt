The story begins with the christening of Prince Alphege, son of the King and his first wife. The King's second wife, a Princess of undeniable beauty, is jealous of her stepson and takes measures to get rid of him.

The Wicked Queen sends a trusty servant to the Fairy of the Mountain, asking her to devise some means by which she might get rid of her stepson. The Fairy replies that it is impossible for her to attempt anything against the young Prince, who is under the protection of some greater Power.

The Wicked Queen then plots to have the Prince visit his aunt, the King's sister, in a distant country. The Prince sets forth on his travels with his devoted governess and her husband, but shortly after crossing the border, he disappears.

A black monkey suddenly appears and tells the courtiers that the Prince will not be restored to them until they have failed to recognise him. The courtiers return to the palace and break the news to the King, who falls ill and dies not long after.

The Wicked Queen becomes Queen in her own son's place and rules with a hard hand. Meanwhile, the Prince's governess and her daughter continue to mourn the loss of their dear Prince.

One day, while hunting, the young King spots a little monkey of the brightest green and takes him back to the palace. The monkey is really Prince Alphege, who has been transformed in this strange fashion.

The Wicked Queen soon discovers that the monkey is really her stepson and plots to have him killed. The Prince's governess and her daughter, however, refuse to give him up and instead keep him hidden.

The Wicked Queen sends the King to the governess's palace to find out the truth for himself. When the King arrives, he is surprised to see his brother, who has been lost for many years.

Prince Alphege tells his story and is crowned King. He marries his governess's daughter and they all live happily ever after.
