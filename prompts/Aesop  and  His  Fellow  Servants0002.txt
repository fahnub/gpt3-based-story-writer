Outline: A merchant is preparing for a journey and assigns his servants various tasks and burdens to carry. Aesop, the slave of the merchant, is given the task of carrying the bread basket, which is the heaviest burden.

Aesop struggles to carry the basket but perseveres. When it is time to distribute the food, Aesop does so equally among all the servants, lightening his own load in the process.

For the rest of the journey, Aesop only has to carry an empty basket, while the other servants struggle under the weight of their heavier loads. The other servants eventually come to admire Aesop's ingenuity in managing his burden.

Aesop is told to distribute his load evenly at dinner, which lightens the load by half. He gets rid of the rest at supper. For the remainder of the journey, he has nothing to carry but an empty basket.

He  did  so,    and  this  lightened  his  burden  one  half,  and  when  supper-time  arrived  he    got  rid  of  the  rest.  For  the  remainder  of  the  journey  he  had  nothing  but  the  empty  basket  to    carry,  and  the  other  Servants,  whose  loads  seemed  to  get  heavier  and    heavier  at
