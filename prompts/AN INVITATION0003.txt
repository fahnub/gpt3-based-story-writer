Outline: Rusty Wren's cousin, Long Bill, is having a party tomorrow at his home near Black Creek and has sent old Mr. Crow to deliver the invitation. When Jolly Robin arrives with the message, Rusty is excited to attend but his wife is not pleased as it is a men's party. Rusty promises to help his wife with her house-cleaning tomorrow but is clearly eager to attend the party. His wife warns him that he will be busy at home. The next day, Rusty goes to the party while his wife stays home to clean.

Story so far:  Rusty's wife is upset about something, so he decides it is best if their visitor does not stay too long. Rusty says he is going to the orchard to hunt for insects and Mrs. Rusty tells him to remember that he has to be busy at home tomorrow. A woman tells a man that she won't be able to attend a party because her husband is helping her with housework. The man looks worried but doesn't say anything. Rusty Wren's cousin, Long Bill, lived in the reeds on the bank of Black Creek. Although everybody called him "Long Bill," like Rusty Wren he was actually short and chubby. His bill, however, was much longer than Rusty's. The speaker seems to be in a hurry to get to the orchard, which suggests that he may be trying to get away from home. Rusty seldom left home, but when he did, he met his cousin Long Bill. Long Bill was fond of water and didn't care to spend time near Rusty's home, which didn't have any large bodies of water nearby. The passage tells the story of how Rusty Wren and his wife were invited to a party by Jolly Robin. The party is being held by Mr. Crow, and will take place tomorrow. Rusty's wife is excited to attend, and Rusty is eager to find out more about it. Rusty Wren's cousin Long Bill is having a party, and Rusty is invited.

Last chunk: seen nor heard of his cousin,  when one day Jolly Robin knocked at his door.  "I won't come in," said Jolly (of course he couldn't have,  anyhow--being far too big to get through Rusty's door!). "I won't  come in, for I merely want to give you a message. Old Mr. Crow came  to the orchard to-day and he asked me to deliver an invitation  from your cousin who lives near Black Creek."  "That's Long Bill!" Rusty Wren exclaimed.  Jolly Robin nodded. "He's going to have a party," he explained.  "And he
