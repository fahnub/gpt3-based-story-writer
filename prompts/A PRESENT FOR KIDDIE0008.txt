Outline: Mr. Frog brings a present for Kiddie Katydid - an overcoat - all the way from the creek. Kiddie is pleased, but a little bit anxious, as he only wears green. Mr. Frog assures him that the overcoat is green and hangs it on a twig for Kiddie to try on later. He then goes back to the watering trough to wet his feet. When he comes back, Kiddie has already tried on the overcoat and loves it.

Story so far:  Mr. Frog has made an overcoat for Kiddie Katydid and is delivering it to him. Kiddie Katydid is pleased with the gift and grateful to Mr. Frog. Mr. Frog tells Kiddie Katydid that he will go hang the coat up and wet his feet, and while he is gone, she can try the coat on. Kiddie Katydid is anxious that the coat is green, because that is her favorite color. Mr. Frog assures her that he will not make a mistake and then leaves. Mr. Frog listens to the animals as they complain about the cold weather. They all eventually give up and go home, except for Mr. Frog, who stays out all night. Kiddie springs down from his tree and takes his new coat from the twig on which the tailor hung it.

Last chunk: look  back and watch, while Kiddie sprang down from his tree and took his new  coat from the twig on which the tailor had hung it.
