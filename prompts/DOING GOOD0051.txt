The Phoenix tells Robert that he must perform good deeds in order to be rewarded in the afterlife. Robert is disgusted by this and refuses to do so. The woman in the passage is speaking in a foreign language and ends with a question. Robert, who is holding the Phoenix, asks it to translate the woman's words. The children in the passage want to take their mother to see the Psammead, but they are worried about her reaction. An old woman, a young boy, and a lady went to visit a priest.
