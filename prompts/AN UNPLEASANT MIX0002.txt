Outline: The Beaver family visits Mr. Frog's tailor shop, but he always keeps the door locked and the shades drawn. They can hear him giggling and snickering inside, but he never responds to their knocks and calls.

A notice appears on Mr. Frog's door one evening, announcing a fitting day for the Beaver family's new clothes. The young dandies even spend the night in front of the shop to be the first to try on their new clothes.

When Mr. Frog opens his door the next morning, he has to beg his eager customers to keep order. He quickly gets them into their new clothes, assuring each one that they fit perfectly, and telling them to wait in the back yard.

When Mr. Frog follows the last Beaver into the back yard, he finds that there is a frightful uproar outside. Each Beaver claims that there is something wrong with his new clothes. Mr. Frog declares that they are exactly as they should be, because they are bound to be in style in five years' time.

Ferdinand Frog tells the crowd that they are only not used to being dressed in that fashion. One Beaver, however, shouts angrily that he knows his suit isn't fashionable and that he won't accept it.

Ferdinand Frog tells a crowd of animals that they look queer because they are not used to being dressed in such a fashion. One Beaver, however, angrily rejects his suit. Mr. Frog's new clothes were not up to the Beaver family's standards, but he claimed they were in style and nobody could prove otherwise. Dandies would spend the night in front of Mr. Frog's tailor shop to be the first to try on their new clothes, which were always five years ahead of current fashion. Mr. Frog had to beg his customers to keep order when he opened his shop the next morning, as a crowded shop would lead to mix-ups with the garments. The Beaver family is excited for Mr. Frog's fitting-day tomorrow.

Last chunk: He was working busily, and he did not want to be interrupted.  At last, to the delight of everybody, a notice appeared one evening upon  Mr. Frog's door, which said:  TO-MORROW WILL BE FITTING-DAY  Well, never was such excitement known in the Beaver family--unless it  was when the great freshet came, and almost washed away the dam. And it  was lucky there was no freshet upon Mr. Frog's fitting-day, for there  would have been no one except the women and children to do any work.  Some of the young
