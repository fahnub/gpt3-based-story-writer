Outline: Mrs. Ladybug sees a frog and is scared. The frog, Mr. Cricket Frog, is also scared of Mrs. Ladybug. They both play dead until Mr. Cricket Frog gathers up the courage to talk to Mrs. Ladybug. He tells her that he would never hurt her and she is pleased. They become friends and Mrs. Ladybug goes on her way, thinking what a brave gentleman Mr. Cricket Frog is.

Mr. Cricket Frog is so timid that when he sees a stranger, he sometimes plays dead. This is what happened when he caught sight of Mrs. Ladybug.

Last chunk: the bottom of the pond Mr.  Cricket Frog played dead. He would float in the water as if lifeless,  until his enemy had gone off about his business.  He was so timid--this Mr. Cricket Frog--that when he saw a stranger he  would sometimes play dead. And that was exactly what happened when he  caught sight of Mrs. Ladybug as she clung to the grass stalk near the  edge of the duck pond and stared at him.
