Outline: A man named Blue Beard has a lot of money and property, but he also has a blue beard which makes him very ugly and scares away all the women and girls. One of his neighbors has two daughters who are very beautiful, and he asks to marry one of them. The daughters are hesitant because of Blue Beard's beard and the fact that he has married and murdered several wives in the past, but they eventually agree to marry him and go to his country estate for a week.

While they are at the estate, Blue Beard tells his wife that he has to go on a business trip for six weeks and gives her the keys to all his properties. He tells her not to go into one particular closet on the ground floor, but she is very curious and eventually gives in to temptation. Inside the closet, she finds the dead bodies of Blue Beard's previous wives.

Blue Beard comes back from his trip early and realizes that his wife has been in the closet. He threatens to kill her, but she is saved at the last minute by her brothers, who kill Blue Beard instead. She inherits all of his property and lives happily ever after.

The woman in the passage is very curious about the contents of a closet on the ground floor, and despite her husband's orders, she rushes down a staircase to get to it. She is worried about the consequences of disobeying her husband, but her curiosity is too strong to resist. Blue Beard noticed that his wife was acting strangely and asked her why the key to his closet was not with the other keys. She said she must have left it upstairs and he told her to bring it to him. When she gave it to him, he noticed a stain on it and asked her how it got there. She said she didn't know and he became very angry.

Last chunk: such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened.  "How is it," said he, "that the key of my closet is not among the rest?"  "I must certainly," said she, "have left it upstairs upon the table."  "Do not fail," said Blue Beard, "to bring it to me presently."  After having put off doing it several times, she was forced to bring him the key. Blue Beard, having examined it, said to his wife:--  "How comes this stain upon the key?"  "I do not know," cried the poor woman, paler than
