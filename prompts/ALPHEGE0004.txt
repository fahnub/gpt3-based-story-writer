Outline: Alphege, or the Green Monkey, is a story about a young prince who is transformed into a monkey and must find his way back to his human form in order to claim his rightful place on the throne.

The story begins with the christening of Prince Alphege, son of the King and his first wife. The King's second wife, a Princess of undeniable beauty, is jealous of her stepson and takes measures to get rid of him.

The Wicked Queen sends a trusty servant to the Fairy of the Mountain, asking her to devise some means by which she might get rid of her stepson. The Fairy replies that it is impossible for her to attempt anything against the young Prince, who is under the protection of some greater Power.

The Wicked Queen then plots to have the Prince visit his aunt, the King's sister, in a distant country. The Prince sets forth on his travels with his devoted governess and her husband, but shortly after crossing the border, he disappears.

A black monkey suddenly appears and tells the courtiers that the Prince will not be restored to them until they have failed to recognise him. The courtiers return to the palace and break the news to the King, who falls ill and dies not long after.

The Wicked Queen becomes Queen in her own son's place and rules with a hard hand. Meanwhile, the Prince's governess and her daughter continue to mourn the loss of their dear Prince.

One day, while hunting, the young King spots a little monkey of the brightest green and takes him back to the palace. The monkey is really Prince Alphege, who has been transformed in this strange fashion.

The Wicked Queen soon discovers that the monkey is really her stepson and plots to have him killed. The Prince's governess and her daughter, however, refuse to give him up and instead keep him hidden.

The Wicked Queen sends the King to the governess's palace to find out the truth for himself. When the King arrives, he is surprised to see his brother, who has been lost for many years.

Prince Alphege tells his story and is crowned King. He marries his governess's daughter and they all live happily ever after.

Story so far:  Lady Godiva was a very unpopular ruler, and it was believed that she had killed Prince Alphege. Her son was loved by the people, and she retired with her daughter to their own house. The little monkey kept gazing at Zayda with such sad and loving eyes that she and her mother could not think what to make of it, and they were even more surprised when they saw big tears rolling down his cheeks. The Wicked Queen sends her godson, the Prince, a large ruby with the instruction to wear it at all times. The ruby will protect the Prince as long as he remains within his father's dominions.

Last chunk: carefully over her godson. She was  obliged to do so from a distance, her own country being a remote one,  but she was well informed of all that went on and knew all about the  Queen's wicked designs. She therefore sent the Prince a large and  splendid ruby, with injunctions to wear it night and day as it would  protect him from all attacks, but added that the talisman only retained  its power as long as the Prince remained within his father's dominions.  The Wicked Queen knowing this made every
