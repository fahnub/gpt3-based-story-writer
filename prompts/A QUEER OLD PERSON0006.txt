Outline: Grandfather Mole is a queer old creature who lives in Farmer Green's garden. He is mostly blind and has very small ears, but he is a great digger and has made himself a large home underground. He mostly eats angleworms, which he finds by burrowing through the soil, but he is content to eat any grubs or worms he finds. He is happy with his life and only ever complains about the scarcity of angleworms.

Story so far:  Grandfather Mole was an odd person whose neighbors said he had no ears. Grandfather Mole himself sometimes remarked that he didn't know how he could have burrowed as he did if he had been forever getting dirt in his eyes and ears. He seemed quite satisfied to be just as he was. Grandfather Mole was contented with his lot, except for the scarcity of angleworms.

Last chunk: seem great drawbacks to others, Grandfather  Mole was contented with his lot. The only thing he was ever known to  grumble about was the scarcity of angleworms.
