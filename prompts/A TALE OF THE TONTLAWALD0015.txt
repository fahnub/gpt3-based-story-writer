Story so far: A girl brings home a wood sprite as a companion. Her mother is initially skeptical but eventually warms up to the sprite and allows her to stay. The passage tells the story of a girl who was cursed by a wicked woman, but was later able to break the curse and live a happy life. A large golden cock appears every meal time in response to the old man striking a granite block three times with a small silver staff. The passage describes Elsa's entreaties to the lady not to be sent back to the world of men. She begs to be allowed to stay and serve the lady in any capacity, rather than be sent away. The lady of the house wants to adopt Elsa as her daughter. The passage describes a peasant girl named Elsa who is abused by her stepmother. Despite her suffering, Elsa remains a good and quiet girl. One day, she goes out strawberry picking with some other village children and gets lost. A bad woman seldom becomes better as she grows older, and Elsa's double had not fared well in Elsa's native village over the years. The stepmother was cruel to the girl, often beating her. One day, she threatened to kill the girl, but when she tried to strangle her, the figure that had taken the girl's place could feel no pain and the stepmother couldn't kill her. The girls step into a mussel shell which has turned into a boat, and are carried away by the water.

Only under their feet was a tiny dry spot. Then the girl placed the mussel shell on the water and took the fish scales in her hand. The mussel shell grew bigger and bigger, and turned into a pretty little boat, which would have held a dozen children. The girls stepped in, Elsa very cautiously, for which she was much laughed at
