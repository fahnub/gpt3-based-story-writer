Outline: In the story, "A Warning," Timothy Turtle is visiting the beaver pond and is being rude to everyone he meets. He complains about the pond and the frogs, and says that he doesn't understand why anyone would want to live there. He also says that he won't be back for forty years.

 Brownie Beaver's mother is the fat lady that Timothy Turtle grabs by the tail. After she is insulted by Timothy, Brownie Beaver decides that he will make Timothy Turtle work.

The Beavers are always working on their dam, and Timothy Turtle often watches them. One day, a Beaver asks Timothy if he wants to help them, and Timothy gets angry. He says that he never has worked and never intends to.

 Brownie Beaver decides to put Timothy to work anyway. He makes Timothy climb a steep bluff, and Timothy falls and hurts himself. Timothy learns his lesson and decides that maybe he should try working after all.

Story so far:  Timothy Turtle is not interested in working, and he makes this clear to the others by snapping at the suggestion. He then proceeds to show his displeasure by making a pass at the person who had made the suggestion. The passage describes how a turtle grew to be so large that the water rushing through it would drain a pond dry. The turtle liked watching the beavers work, but complained that they should work during the day so that he could see them better. Timothy Turtle is a very disagreeable and snappish creature who complains about everything. He is not liked by anyone in the village and is always grumbling.

Last chunk: A WARNING (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)    Timothy Turtle's visit at the beaver pond was just like all of his  outings. Wherever he went he was so disagreeable and snappish that there  wasn't a single person in the whole village that didn't wish Timothy had  stayed away from that place.  He was forever grumbling, complaining that the fishing was poor in the  pond. And as for frogs, he declared that he hadn't seen even one.  "Why anybody wants to live here is more than I can understand." That was  what
