Outline: Sandy Chipmunk is searching for food in the spring and comes across Mr. Crow who is in a hurry and doesn't have time to talk. Sandy remembers what Uncle Jerry Chuck said about Mr. Crow going to the field where Farmer Green is planting corn and decides to run over and see what is going on. When he arrives, he sees that Mr. Crow is already there, eating the corn. Sandy Chipmunk begins to eat the corn as well and is soon joined by Mr. Crow who is angry that Sandy is there. Mr. Crow tells Sandy that the corn belongs to Farmer Green and Sandy should leave. Sandy Chipmunk tells Mr. Crow that there is enough corn for both of them and Mr. Crow starts to complain about Sandy being a nuisance. Suddenly, Mr. Crow sees Farmer Green coming and flies off in a hurry. Sandy Chipmunk stays and eats all the corn he wants and is never seen by Farmer Green. Mr. Crow is angry with Sandy for following him and eating the corn.

Story so far:  Sandy Chipmunk remembers that Uncle Jerry Chuck had said that Mr. Crow was going to the field where Farmer Green was going to plant corn. Sandy runs over to the field to see if this is true and finds out that Mr. Crow was just going to eat some of the corn. Sandy Chipmunk has an idea when he sees old Mr. Crow and hopes he won't be seen. Mr. Crow tells Sandy he has to leave and Sandy stays to eat all the corn he wants. Mr. Crow is mad at Sandy for following him and eating the corn. Mr. Crow and Sandy Chipmunk are both stealing corn kernels from a field. Mr. Crow is enjoying his meal when he sees Sandy Chipmunk also stealing corn. Sandy Chipmunk is hungry because there is no food in Pleasant Valley and all the insects are flying high. Mr. Crow and Sandy Chipmunk are arguing about whether or not Mr. Crow is eating corn from Farmer Green's field. Sandy Chipmunk thinks he is, and Mr. Crow is indignant, saying that he's only helping Farmer Green and has only scratched up a few kernels to see if he's planting them properly. The trouble with Mr. Crow was that he wanted all the corn for himself and didn't want anyone else to visit the cornfield. Mr. Crow is in a hurry and doesn't want to stop to talk. He has something important to do that he's been expecting for a long time. Sandy asks where he's going, but Mr. Crow says it's none of his business.

Last chunk: day. Mr. Crow was  just about to fly somewhere. He seemed to be in a great hurry. In fact,  he did not want to stop to talk--which was most unusual with him.  "I can't chat with you to-day," Mr. Crow told Sandy. "I have business to  attend to. It's something I've been expecting for a long time. And I  don't want to be late."  "Where are you going?" Sandy asked.  "That--" said Mr. Crow--"that is something that doesn't concern you,  young man." And then he flapped his way through the woods and out
