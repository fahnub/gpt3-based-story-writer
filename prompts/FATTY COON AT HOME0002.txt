Outline: Fatty Coon is a young raccoon who is never satisfied with the food his mother brings him. He is always looking for something else to eat and is always getting into adventures as a result. One day, he goes off in search of food and comes across a frog. He tries to eat it but it jumps away. Fatty gives chase but the frog is too fast for him. Fatty is about to give up when he sees the frog jump into a deep pool of water. Fatty knows he can't swim so he gets an idea. He finds a long stick and ties it to his tail. Then he swings out over the pool of water on the stick and grabs the frog. He is so proud of himself that he takes the frog home to show his mother.

Story so far:  This passage describes the differences between Mrs. Coon, Fatty, and Blackie. Mrs. Coon is bigger than her children, Fatty is rounder than his siblings, and Blackie is Fatty's brother. They all live in the hollow branch of an old tree by a brook in the swamp. Fatty Coon was always hungry and would eat anything he could get his hands on, including bugs, snakes, and chickens. One day, after he had devoured all the fish his mother had brought home for him, he asked her if that was all there was. Mrs. Coon sighed, wishing her son would be content with what he had. The passage describes the physical appearance and personality traits of three raccoon siblings. Fatty is the gluttonous one who is never satisfied with his mother's cooking. Fluffy is the one with slightly fluffier fur, and Cutey is the one with the quaint personality. Fatty Coon was a very fat raccoon who loved to eat more than anything. This led to him having many adventures, especially near the swamp by his home. The Coon family all look alike, with six black rings around their tails, a dark brown 'mask' of fur across their faces, and a stiff white moustache.

Last chunk: Fatty Coon lived with his mother and his brother and  his two sisters. Among them all there was what grown people call "a  strong family resemblance," which is the same thing as saying that they  all looked very much alike. The tail of each one of them--mother and  children too--had six black rings around it. Each of them had a dark  brown patch of fur across the face, like a mask. And--what do you  think?--each of them, even Fatty and his brother and his sisters, had a  stiff, white moustache!
