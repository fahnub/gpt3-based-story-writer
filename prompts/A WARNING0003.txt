Outline: In the story, "A Warning," Timothy Turtle is visiting the beaver pond and is being rude to everyone he meets. He complains about the pond and the frogs, and says that he doesn't understand why anyone would want to live there. He also says that he won't be back for forty years.

 Brownie Beaver's mother is the fat lady that Timothy Turtle grabs by the tail. After she is insulted by Timothy, Brownie Beaver decides that he will make Timothy Turtle work.

The Beavers are always working on their dam, and Timothy Turtle often watches them. One day, a Beaver asks Timothy if he wants to help them, and Timothy gets angry. He says that he never has worked and never intends to.

 Brownie Beaver decides to put Timothy to work anyway. He makes Timothy climb a steep bluff, and Timothy falls and hurts himself. Timothy learns his lesson and decides that maybe he should try working after all.

Story so far:  Timothy Turtle is not interested in working, and he makes this clear to the others by snapping at the suggestion. He then proceeds to show his displeasure by making a pass at the person who had made the suggestion. The passage describes how a turtle grew to be so large that the water rushing through it would drain a pond dry. The turtle liked watching the beavers work, but complained that they should work during the day so that he could see them better. Timothy Turtle is a very disagreeable and snappish creature who complains about everything. He is not liked by anyone in the village and is always grumbling. Timothy Turtle was very rude to the people he met, and they didn't appreciate it. He said he only came to their pond because he wanted a change, and that he wouldn't be back for a long time. The passage describes how Timothy Turtle's actions hurt the feelings of the Beaver family, especially the fat lady. Timothy Turtle explains that he was just trying to give her a rest.

Last chunk: remarks hurt the Beaver family's feelings. And  when Timothy Turtle seized a fat lady by the tail one day and wouldn't  let her go until sunset, her feelings were hurt most of all. She cried  that she had never been so insulted in all her life.  Timothy Turtle merely said that she ought not to object. He explained  that he had been _giving her a rest_--for of course she couldn't cut  down a tree, nor work upon the dam that held the water in the pond,  while he clung fast to her tail.  Well, this
