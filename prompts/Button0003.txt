Story so far: Button Bright and his friends are stranded on a mountain. Button Bright asks the Ork if he can see how his tail works, and the Ork explains that it is his tail and he reserves the right to whirl it himself. Button-Bright then proposes they go out and fly somewhere so he can see how the tail works. The Ork declines, saying he only flies when he is going somewhere. Cap'n Bill releases all the birds except for three, which Trot decides are the most beautiful she has ever seen. The Wizard of Oz presents the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion with gray clothes, which they use to make swings to ride on the birds. The Ork is their leader. Three of the bird-men agree to be transformed by the one-legged man, who assures them that the transformation will be permanent. The bird-men seem to want to be bigger for some reason. The old sailor ties all the birds together and fastens them to a stone so they can't escape. The Bumpy Man watches with curiosity and asks what will happen to the birds when they find they can't fly.

The Bumpy Man explains that he is covered in bumps because he was once a popcorn kernel that was popped. The Bumpy Man does not know how to get away from Mo. Dorothy and the shaggy man discuss what will become of them. Dorothy admits that she does not know what will become of her, and the shaggy man laughs, saying that no one knows everything. A man with a wooden leg and two children ask three birds to carry them to another country. The man in the passage explains that all snow is popcorn in the Land of Mo. Trot, who is from a different country, is surprised by this. The man becomes impatient with her and tells her to make the best of it.

Last chunk: "Of course not," replied the man. "It was cold last night, before the  snowstorm; but snow, when it falls, is always crisp and warm."  Trot gathered a handful of it.  "Why, it's popcorn?" she cried.  "Certainly; all snow is popcorn. What did you expect it to be?"  "Popcorn is not snow in my country."  "Well, it is the only snow we have in the Land of Mo, so you may as  well make the best of it," said he, a little impatiently. "I'm not  responsible for the absurd things that happen in your
