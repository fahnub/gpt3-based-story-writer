Outline: Jasper Jay ignores Mr. Crow's warning and imitates Mr. Red-shouldered Hawk's cry, much to the latter's anger. Jasper hides in an oak tree in the farmyard, waiting to scare the hens with the hawk's cry. His plans are thwarted when Noisy Jake screams first, sending the hens and their chicks running for cover. Jasper gets revenge on Noisy Jake by sending him to a different tree, but is caught by the hawk himself.

Jasper let out a blood-curdling cry to hurry the last hen under cover, but he had to admit that Noisy Jake's cry sounded more like Mr. Hawk's than his own. He wished he had not told Noisy Jake where he was going.

Last chunk: it was his turn!"  Since he didn't want to miss _all_ the fun, Jasper let out a  blood-curdling "_Kee-you! kee-you!_" himself, just to hurry the last hen  under cover. But, somehow, he had to confess to himself--though he  wouldn't have admitted it to anybody else--he had to confess that Noisy  Jake's cry sounded far more like Mr. Hawk's than did his own.
