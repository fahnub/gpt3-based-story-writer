Outline: Columbus sets sail from Spain in 1492 in search of a new land. He and his crew travel west across the ocean, eventually landing in the Americas. There, they meet the native people and learn about their culture and way of life. Columbus also collects some souvenirs to take back to Spain, including some sparkling stones. He then sets sail for home, arriving back in Spain in 1493.

Story so far:  Columbus sailed to the United States in three ships, finding land and Indians there. He took some rocks and nuts back with him to show the king. Spain. In 1492, Columbus crossed the seas and told a tale that is mostly true.
