Outline: The story is about a frog who is a tailor and the beaver family who are his customers. The frog is trying to collect payment from the beavers for their new clothes, but the beavers refuse to pay, saying that it's not fashionable to do so. The frog then tricks the beavers into paying him by pretending that he will make their clothes for free if they promise to wear them. The beavers agree and the frog gets his payment. In the end, the frog laughs at the beavers for their new clothes and for falling for his trick.

Story so far:  In this fable, Mr. Frog tries to convince the Beaver family that they need to pay him for their new suits, even though it is not fashionable to do so. The Beavers object, but Mr. Frog insists. In the end, the Beavers are forced to pay and learn their lesson. Mr. Frog asks Stingy Steve to pay him back sixty tape-measures, which is what he borrowed. Steve gives him one back and runs away. This passage describes the speaker's feelings towards people who are "a bit like them." The speaker seems to have mixed feelings, perhaps feeling both attracted to and repelled by these people. Stingy Steve tells Ferdinand Frog that he will pay him in inches, not money. Frog objects, but Steve insists that this will be the norm in five years. Frog is incredulous, but soon realizes that Steve's customers are all paying in the same way. Mr. Frog is offered payment for his services, but he declines, instead asking that the people promise to wear the new clothes he will make for them. They agree, and he leaps into the air in celebration. A frog is asking a group of animals to pay him for a delivery, and warning them not to crowd. When nobody moves, he jumps in front of a beaver. Mr. Frog plays a trick on the Beavers by somersaulting into the pond and laughing loudly. The Beavers cannot see or hear him and he knows they will not think him impolite.

Last chunk: times.  After that he turned a back somersault, and then he rolled over and over  until he landed with a great splash in the pond.  Deep down on the muddy bottom Mr. Frog laughed as if he could never  stop. The Beavers on the bank could neither see nor hear him. And he  knew there was no danger of their thinking him impolite, especially when  he said:  "They don't even know that I've played a trick on them! And what a  terrible sight they are! I've never seen any company that looked the  least
