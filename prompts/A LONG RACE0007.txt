Outline: Ferdinand Frog meets a Great Blue Heron and is impressed by the size of his bill. The heron tells Ferdinand that he is moving into the area and Ferdinand is immediately worried that the heron will eat him. The heron reassures Ferdinand that he is not interested in eating frogs and the two become friends. Ferdinand is amazed by the heron's bill and says that it would be useful for making button-holes. The heron is amused by this comment and flies away.

Story so far: A vain bird is pleased when a frog compliments the length and sharpness of its bill. The bird then reveals that it lives beyond the Second Mountain. Miss Kitty Cat knows the way back to Farmer Green's place, although she couldn't tell you how she knows. Miss Kitty Cat is on a journey and decides to go down the road instead of up the road because she remembers that the wagon had been climbing a long hill before it turned into the peddler's dooryard. The famous race between Grumpy Weasel and Jimmy Rabbit goes on and on, with Jimmy trying to lose the weasel by running through Pleasant Valley. Jimmy grows tired and stopped to rest, but Grumpy Weasel never stopped once. The speaker never felt better in their life, except for being hungry. They are in a race and their opponents beg them to stop and rest, which they agree to. The speaker laughs at their opponents. Ferdinand Frog is relieved to find out that the huge bird he encountered is not a grizzly bear, but is instead G. B. Heron. Miss Kitty Cat frightens some birds by sharpening her claws against a tree trunk, then sets off for Pleasant Valley. Jimmy Rabbit is racing against Grumpy Weasel and is worried he will lose or that Grumpy will catch up to him. Mr. Frog is curious about a big bird with a long, sharp bill, and tells the stranger that he has a long, sharp bill. This passage is from a children's book and it is about a grumpy hen who visits Mrs. Hen. The passage ends with the two hens laughing.
