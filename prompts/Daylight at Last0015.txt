Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

Story so far:  The explorers find a melon on the ground and are delighted. The Ork offers to carry Trot and Cap'n Bill up the well, with Trot sitting on its shoulders and Cap'n Bill grabbing hold of its legs. The Ork is spinning Trot and Cap'n Bill around in the air, and they are both clinging to the Ork for dear life. A house has been built at the edge of the forest, and the speaker and Trot are going to see if anyone is living there. The Ork escapes the well and is relieved to be in the sunlight again. The Ork tells Cap'n Bill and Trot that he will take them with him when he leaves the cave, and Cap'n Bill expresses concern about falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The passage describes the Ork's sudden release of its passengers, which sent them rolling. Cap'n Bill was pleased with the Ork's care for them and found the place they landed pretty. Trot was curious about where they were. The passage describes the various food sources the speaker and Cap'n Bill find on the island they are stranded on. There are melons, cherry trees, and a forest full of nut trees. They will not starve while they are on the island.

Last chunk: gratefully: "Well,  there's no danger of our starving, even if this is an island."  "Melons," remarked Cap'n Bill, "are both food an' water. We couldn't  have struck anything better."  Farther on they came to the cherry trees, where they obtained some of  the fruit, and at the edge of the little forest were wild plums. The  forest itself consisted entirely of nut trees--walnuts, filberts,  almonds and chestnuts--so there would be plenty of wholesome food for  them while they remained there.
