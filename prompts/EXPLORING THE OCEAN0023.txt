Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far:  The barnacles are singing a nonsensical song, and Trot thinks it's stupid. The mermaids quietly rebuked the guests for arguing and being noisy, and reminded them that the queen's guests should be more careful. The dinner provided was delicious, with lobster soup, fried salmon, and oysters, among other seafood dishes. The mermaid warns Cap'n Bill and Trot to watch out for the snapping eels. The eels are very active and can be dangerous.

Last chunk: people like that," said Cap'n Bill with a nod of his  head. "An' they has a way of upsettin' the happiest folks they  meet."  "Look out!" suddenly cried the mermaid. "Look out for your fingers!  Here are the snapping eels."  "Who? Where?" asked Trot anxiously.  And now they were in the midst of a cluster of wriggling, darting  eels which sported all around them in the water with marvelous  activity. "Yes, look out for your fingers and your noses!" said one  of the eels, making a dash for Cap'n
