Outline: Mrs. Ladybug is trying to take Jennie Junebug to task for eating the leaves of Farmer Green's trees, but Jennie is too rough and knocks the breath out of Mrs. Ladybug instead. Mrs. Ladybug sends Miss Moth to find Freddie Firefly and ask him for help. Freddie Firefly comes up with the idea to ask Jennie why she doesn't bump into Solomon Owl. Jennie likes the idea and does just that. Solomon Owl is not amused and goes looking for Jennie. Jennie hides until he leaves, then announces she is moving away and is never seen again on Farmer Green's property.

Story so far:  Freddie Firefly persuades Solomon Owl to fly down into the meadow, where he plans to make Solomon Owl collide with Jennie Junebug. A ladybug is angry with a Junebug for bowling her over and eating leaves from a farmer's garden. Mrs. Ladybug is trying to figure out how to stop Jennie Junebug from eating the leaves off Farmer Green's fruit trees. Freddie suggests that she just talk to Jennie and explain how she's affecting the trees.

Last chunk: he was only too glad to escape her attentions. He found her too rough to  suit him.  Mrs. Ladybug quickly explained her difficulty.  "What shall I do?" she asked him.  "I don't know," he answered. "I can't do a thing with Jennie Junebug.  She knocks me down whenever I meet her. She annoys me."  "It's not so much myself I'm thinking of," said Mrs. Ladybug. "It's  Farmer Green's fruit trees that I'm disturbed about. Jennie Junebug eats  the leaves. I must put an end to that."  "I have it!" Freddie
