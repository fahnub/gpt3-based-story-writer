Story so far: A man named Esben is captured by a witch and put in a dark hole to fatten him up, but his daughter eventually grows to like her captor and decides not to kill him. Esben's brothers say they can get him a special dove with feathers of gold and silver, but only if they are threatened with death. The king then has the brothers called before him and accuses them of lying. The brothers deny the accusation and insist that such a dove does not exist. SirRed is angry and jealous of the brothers, and plans to get them into trouble. He tells the king that they can get a lamp that will shine over seven kingdoms, and the king orders them to bring it to him. Esben takes the witch's dove and she chases after him, asking if he did all of the things she's accused him of. He says "that may be" and she continues to chase him. A man named Esben brings a magical coverlet to the king, who is very pleased. The other kings are angry because they don't have one like it. Esben tells the story of how he and his eleven brothers got the coverlet, and how they were almost executed because of it. Esben went to get a boar for the king and was successful. His brothers were very grateful but did not thank him. The king was even more grateful and gave them a reward.

Last chunk: eleven daughters?'  'Ye--e--s!'  'Are you coming back again?'  'That may be,' said Esben.  'Then you'll catch it,' said the witch.  Esben was soon back at the palace with the boar, and his brothersscarcely knew which leg to stand on, so rejoiced were they that theywere safe again. Not one of them, however, ever thought of thankingEsben for what he had done for them.  The king was still more rejoiced over the boar than he had been over thedove, and did not know what to give the brothers for it.
