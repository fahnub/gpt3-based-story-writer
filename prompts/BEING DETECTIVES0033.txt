Story so far:  Oswald and Dicky try to look through a hole in a flower pot on a window ledge to see coiners, but they don't see anything. The passage describes a boy named Albert who is waiting for a train with his uncle. His uncle tells him that the books he is reading are poorly translated and written in bad English. Albert disagrees, saying that they are still good stories. Alice is unconvinced by the justification for capital punishment, saying that she would be more interested in being a detective who catches criminals than in being a murderer herself. Alice's hero tries to retrieve something from a flower pot, but falls and hits his head on an iron pillar, rendering himself unconscious.

'You've done it this time!' he said, then he fell heavily among the  flower-pots piled below. He heard them crash and rattle and crack, and  then his head struck against an iron pillar used for holding up the  next-door veranda. His eyes closed and he knew no more.  Now you will perhaps expect that at this moment Alice would have cried  'Murder!'
