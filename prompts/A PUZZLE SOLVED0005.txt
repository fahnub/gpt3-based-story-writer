Outline: Grandfather Mole is burrowing his way through Farmer Green's garden when he is stopped by Jolly Robin. Jolly Robin asks him how long it will take Grunty Pig to dig up the apple tree where he lives. Grandfather Mole says it all depends on how much time Grunty Pig spends digging. Jolly Robin explains that Grunty Pig works every day and boasts that he will have the tree uprooted before fall. Grandfather Mole tells Jolly Robin that Grunty Pig will not be able to uprooted the tree in ninety-nine summers. Jolly Robin is pleased with this news and hurries home to his wife. Mrs. Robin is glad to see her husband and he tells her the news. Mrs. Robin says that Grunty Pig is stupid and has turned up at least a dozen angleworms while her husband was gone.
