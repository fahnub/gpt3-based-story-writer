Outline: A long, long time ago, in the west of America, there lived an old man who had one son. The son and his friends used to spend their days hunting in the forest. One day, they went out as usual to hunt, but the leader of the group killed most of the animals. They started back for the village with their game, but the leader left his pack on the bank of the river and went home another way. When the old man went to get the pack, he drowned and was turned into a piece of wood. The wood floated downstream and was caught by a woman who used it as a table. When she tried to eat off the table, her food disappeared. The woman had a baby that grew very quickly into a man. The man restored the woman's sight and then left to go back to his own home. On the way, he stopped to eat dinner with two old women. He gave them his hair, which turned into a fishing net, and caught some salmon. The old women told him to go home, and he got in a basket and was lowered into a deep hole. He fell asleep and was drawn up by the old women. The man continued on his way and finally reunited with his family.

Story so far:  Someone put a young man in a basket and told him to wrap a blanket around his head. They warned him not to uncover his head until he reached the bottom. The young man forgot and looked out of the basket. The basket then moved up instead of down. A piece of wood that was once a man floats down a river and is caught by a woman who plans to use it as a table.
