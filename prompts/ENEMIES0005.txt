Outline: Jasper Jay and Reddy Woodpecker are two birds who are fond of beechnuts. When Jasper Jay hears that Reddy Woodpecker is planning to spend the winter in the same area, he is furious and enlists the help of Jimmy Rabbit to drive Reddy away.

Jimmy Rabbit comes up with a plan and tells Jasper Jay to stand beside a cedar tree near a puddle of water. Jasper does as he is told, grumbling all the while.

Soon, Reddy Woodpecker appears on the scene. He is looking for beechnuts and is startled to see Jasper Jay standing there. When Reddy tries to get closer, Jasper Jay splashes him with water from the puddle.

Reddy is angry and tries to retaliate, but Jasper Jay is too quick for him. Every time Reddy tries to get close, Jasper Jay splashes him with water, until finally Reddy gives up and flies away.

Jasper Jay is triumphant and thanks Jimmy Rabbit for his help.

Story so far:  Jasper Jay and Reddy Woodpecker are enemies who both like beechnuts. They are both noisy and quarrelsome, and they both steal and eat the eggs and young of other birds. Jasper Jay and Reddy Woodpecker are two birds who are very similar to each other, but they quarrel often. When Jasper Jay heard that Reddy Woodpecker was going to spend the winter in the North, he was very angry. Jimmy Rabbit offers to help Jasper Jay fight Reddy Woodpecker, and Jasper agrees to let him handle the situation.

Last chunk: think I can please you," said Jimmy Rabbit. "But you'll have to do  exactly as I say, or my plan won't work."  Now, Jasper Jay was really not at all eager to fight Reddy Woodpecker.  Reddy had a very sharp bill, which was even longer than Jasper's, and  just as strong. And Reddy could strike a powerful blow with his bill. So  Jasper Jay was glad enough to accept help from a person like Jimmy  Rabbit, who was always thinking of new schemes.  "I'll leave everything to you," said Jasper.  "Good!"
