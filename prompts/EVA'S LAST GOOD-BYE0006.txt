Outline: Eva is a young girl who is very ill. Her uncle, Tom, is a slave who loves her very much and takes care of her. Eva knows she is going to die soon and she makes her uncle promise to free him when she dies.

A few nights later, Eva dies in her sleep. True to his promise, Mr. St. Clare goes to his lawyer to start the process of freeing Tom. He tells Tom to pack his things and get ready to go home.

While Tom is waiting for Mr. St. Clare to come home from a ride, he falls asleep on the verandah. He is awakened by a loud knock at the gate and he runs to open it. It is Mr. St. Clare, who has been in an accident and is dying.

Tom stays with Mr. St. Clare until he dies, and then he goes home to his wife and children as a free man.

Story so far:  Eva is very ill and everyone tries to make her comfortable. Tom expresses his preference for having his own poor belongings over having the best belongings that belong to someone else. St. Clare comments that he doesn't understand why Tom feels this way, but accepts it.

But, mas'r, I'd rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything, and have 'em mine than have the best, and have 'em any man's else. I had so, mas'r. I thinks it's nature, mas'r.'  'I suppose so, Tom. You will be going off and leaving me, in a month or two,' he said, rather discontentedly. 'Though why you shouldn't, I don't know,' he added, in a gayer voice.  [Illustration]
