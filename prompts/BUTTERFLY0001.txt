Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug's paintbrush falls to the ground after her cousin tells her that her children are in danger from Freddie Firefly. Butterfly Bill is warning Mrs. Ladybug not to touch his cousin with a brush, because the dust on them is what gives them their beautiful colors. Bill sees that Jennie Junebug is the one who spoke to him. She had noticed the crowd from a distance and had just arrived, quite out of breath. Jennie actually threatens Bill, saying she will have to knock him down if he was talking about her. Bill knows that Jennie enjoys flying into people after dark, but he did not know she only did this unladylike trick then. Butterfly Bill flew away in fright after JennieJunebug said she hoped he didn't mean her friend Mrs. Ladybug. Mrs. Ladybug noticed the dust on his wings and muttered that the Butterfly family are a peculiar lot. This passage is about a butterfly. The speaker invites the butterfly to sit on their chin and gives it a kiss. The butterfly then flies off to the flowers.

Last chunk: BUTTERFLY (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      Butterfly, butterfly,    Sit on my chin,    Your wings are like tinsel,    So yellow and thin.    Butterfly, butterfly,    Give me a kiss;    If you give me a dozen    There's nothing amiss.    Butterfly, butterfly,    Off to the flowers,--    Wee, soulless sprite    Of the long summer hours.
