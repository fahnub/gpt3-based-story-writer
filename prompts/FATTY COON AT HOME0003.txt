Outline: Fatty Coon is a young raccoon who is never satisfied with the food his mother brings him. He is always looking for something else to eat and is always getting into adventures as a result. One day, he goes off in search of food and comes across a frog. He tries to eat it but it jumps away. Fatty gives chase but the frog is too fast for him. Fatty is about to give up when he sees the frog jump into a deep pool of water. Fatty knows he can't swim so he gets an idea. He finds a long stick and ties it to his tail. Then he swings out over the pool of water on the stick and grabs the frog. He is so proud of himself that he takes the frog home to show his mother.

Story so far:  This passage describes the differences between Mrs. Coon, Fatty, and Blackie. Mrs. Coon is bigger than her children, Fatty is rounder than his siblings, and Blackie is Fatty's brother. They all live in the hollow branch of an old tree by a brook in the swamp.

Last chunk: Of course, though they all looked so much alike, you would have known  which was Mrs. Coon, for she was so much bigger than her children. And  you would have known which was Fatty--he was so much rounder than his  brother and his sisters.  Mrs. Coon's home was in the hollow branch of an old tree. It was a giant  of a tree--a poplar close by a brook which ran into the swamp--and the  branch which was Mrs. Coon's home was as big as most tree-trunks are.  Blackie was Fatty's brother--for the mask
