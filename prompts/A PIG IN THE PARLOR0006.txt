Outline: A young child goes to the market in Bonner and meets a pig without a wig. The child is amazed and asks the pig where he got such a beautiful coat. The pig replies that he was born with it and that all pigs are born with beautiful coats. The child is amazed and asks the pig if he can have one of his babies. The pig replies that all pigs are born with beautiful babies and that the child can have one if he wants.

And a moment later Farmer Green's  wife appeared in the doorway. When she saw Grunty Pig she gave a scream.  Mrs. Green couldn't help being surprised at first. But soon she began to  laugh
