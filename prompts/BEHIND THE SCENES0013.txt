Outline: The story is about a woman who is a teacher at a school for children from poor families. She is trying to help a boy named Patsy who has not been coming to school. She goes to his house to find out why and meets his sister Hildegarde. Hildegarde tells her that Patsy is afraid of going to school because he is always late and gets scolded. The woman decides to try to help Patsy by encouraging him and paying him to come to school on time. She also tries to help other children in her class who are having problems.

Story so far: The author is full of guilt and sorrow for not being able to provide her children with the same opportunities for fun and play as other children have. She imagines how much happier and healthier her children would be if they could just enjoy simple childhood pleasures. The passage also describes the author's amusement at the ignorance and hypocrisy of the world, and how they find joy in helping others. Hildegarde has overslept, as usual, and Mrs. Powers has left for the day. I scold Hildegarde roundly, and she scrambles sleepily about the room to find a note that Mrs. Powers has left for me. This passage discusses the difficulty of getting rid of a taste for martyrdom, and how one might need to "receive" in someone's absence. The speaker then gives a few commands, one of which is to tell Paulina Strozynski's big brother to call for her earlier.

Please tell Paulina Strozynski's big brother that he _must_call for her earlier, and not leave her sitting on the steps so long.Tell
