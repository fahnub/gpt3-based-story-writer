Outline: Fatty Coon is a raccoon who is very thin after a long winter of sleeping. He decides to go to Farmer Green's house to see if he can find anything to eat. He smells something delicious coming from a small, low building and goes inside. He finds a row of hams hung up to smoke and starts to eat one. Suddenly, he is thrown to the ground and the ham falls on top of him. He is very frightened and runs all the way home. He later realizes that he had simply bitten through the cord that was holding the ham up, and it fell on him when he tried to take a bite. His children love hearing the story of his adventure.

Story so far:  Fatty would have eaten an elephant if he had the chance. He was very excited to find a ham and ate it quickly. The passage describes a man who is very hungry and does well with only one ham. He makes a hole in the ham and is about to keep going when he is suddenly thrown to the floor and the ham falls on top of him. He choked and sputtered from the ashes but soon managed to kick the ham off. Fatty Coon is very thin after a long winter of sleeping and not eating much. He goes out to look for food and is surprised at how different he looks. Fatty decides that there is no point in looking for food near his home, as the ground is covered in snow and he cannot find anything to eat. He goes to Farmer Green's place and waits there until it gets dark. Fatty was flung to the floor in a barnyard, and he ran home. A month later, he told his mother about the incident, but she didn't know what had caused it.

Last chunk: his stomach and then he felt a little  better. But he was terribly frightened. And though his eyes smarted so  he could hardly see, he sprang up and found the doorway.  Fatty swallowed a whole mouthful of ashes as he dashed across the  barnyard. And he never stopped running until he was almost home. He was  puzzled. Try as he would, he couldn't decide what it was that had flung  him upon the floor. And when he told his mother about his adventure--as  he did a whole month later--she didn't know
