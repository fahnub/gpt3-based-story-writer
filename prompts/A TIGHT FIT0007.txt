Outline: Mr. Crow is a bird who has to fly south for the winter. He is sad because he has to leave his new, warm coat behind. He tries to unbutton it, but he can't seem to manage it. He asks his cousin Jasper Jay to help him, but Jasper refuses. Mr. Crow then goes to ask Fatty Coon for help, and Fatty is able to unbutton the coat for him.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow has a new coat which is too heavy to wear in the South. He hides it somewhere, planning to retrieve it next spring. Mr. Crow hated his spotted coat and wanted to get rid of it, so he went to Fatty Coon's house in the swamp.

Last chunk: friends  in Pleasant Valley except one. And if that one should refuse, Mr. Crow  didn't know what he could do. He had liked his spotted coat. But now he  began to hate it. And he wanted to slip out of it and never see it again.  So Mr. Crow hurried over to the swamp where Fatty Coon lived.
