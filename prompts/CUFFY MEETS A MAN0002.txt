Outline: Cuffy, a greedy little bear, sticks his paws into a pot of boiling maple syrup and gets them covered in the sticky substance. In a panic, he runs outside and shoves his paws into a snowbank in an attempt to cool them down.

Cuffy doesn't realize that the man who tended the sugar-house fire is still nearby, and when the man sees Cuffy, the bear takes off running in the opposite direction. The man gives chase for a few steps but soon realizes he won't be able to catch Cuffy.

In his haste Cuffy did not notice that he was headed in the direction in  which the man had disappeared.  Now it happened that the man who tended the sugar-house fire had gone  only to the edge of the clearing; and
