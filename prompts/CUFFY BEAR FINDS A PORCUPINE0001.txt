Outline: Cuffy Bear and Silkie are playing in the front yard when Cuffy decides he wants to go to the old tree in the pine woods to play. Silkie reminds him that their mother told them not to go far away, but Cuffy doesn't care and goes anyway. When he gets to the old tree, he finds that it's much smaller than he expected because he's grown taller during the months he spent in sleep. He climbs to the top of the tree and sees a small animal covered in quills moving around in the snow. Cuffy remembers his father telling him never to touch a porcupine because if he does, he'll get his paws stuck full of quills. But he decides to show his father that he's clever enough to kill a porcupine, so he steps close to the porcupine and cuffs it with his paw. The next instant, Cuffy howls in pain and realizes that his paw is full of quills. He starts crying and makes his way home, where his mother has to pull the quills out of his paw. Cuffy never touches a porcupine again.

Last chunk: CUFFY BEAR FINDS A PORCUPINE (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    For a few minutes Cuffy stood in the doorway and blinked and blinked. He  rubbed his eyes, for the bright sunlight hurt them. But soon he and  Silkie were frisking and tumbling about in the front-yard.  After a little while Cuffy remembered that there was an old tree over in  the pine woods--just the finest tree to climb that anybody could want.  "Let's go over to the old tree and play," Cuffy said.  "But Mother told us not to go far away,"
