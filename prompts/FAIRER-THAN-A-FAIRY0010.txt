Outline: Once there was a king who had a daughter of remarkable beauty and he named her Fairer-than-a-Fairy. Unknowingly, this name called down the jealousy of the fairies and they resolved to take revenge on the child. The eldest fairy, Lagree, was tasked with taking the child and she did so by kidnapping her and taking her to a hidden underground palace.

The child was seven years old at the time and Lagree kept her there for years, under strict orders never to let the fire in the grate go out. One day, while the child was admiring a rainbow, she heard a voice coming from it and it turned out to be a young man who had been imprisoned in the palace by Lagree. The two of them fell in love and met often, but one day Lagree found out that the fire had gone out and she was furious.

Lagree ordered the child to go and get fire from a nearby monster, Locrinos, who was known to eat young girls. The child went, but was saved by Locrinos's wife who was charmed by her. The child made it back safely and Lagree was even more furious.

Lagree pursued the child, but she was saved by her pet dog and cat who fought off Lagree. The child continued to run and came across a wood full of sweet scents and a silver castle suspended in the air. She went inside and found her love, Prince Rainbow, asleep on a couch.

Fairer-than-a-Fairy woke him and they were reunited. The Queen, Prince Rainbow's mother, was overjoyed to see her son and they all returned to the kingdom. The wedding was celebrated and they lived happily ever after.

Story so far: A princess is set two easy tasks by a fairy, but grows lonely and forgets her father's court. One day, she notices a rainbow and hears a voice coming from it. A woman spills water she had been saving and pours the contents of two bottles into the basin, causing the rainbow to disappear and taking her prince with it. The passage also tells the story of three kind sisters who have magical powers and use them to help those in need. The third sister comforts a traveler and assures her that her troubles would soon be over. The heroine is ordered by a spiteful queen to go to a cruel monster and ask for fire, knowing that he will kill her. A lady gives the Princess a nut and later a golden pomegranate with the instruction to open them in her most urgent need. The new king is about to present his wife to his mother and the court when the three green and white sisters appear and declare her true identity. A king and queen have a baby girl and name her 'Fairer-than-a-Fairy.' The fairies become jealous and try to harm the child. The two lovers were received with joy in the capital and the wedding was celebrated without delay. A bird tells a princess to pick up a shining pebble from a fountain, which she does. The princess then uses the pebble to get a fire from a woman in exchange.

Last chunk: As she was crossing a wood a bird sang to her to pick up  a shining pebble which she would find in a fountain close by, and to use  it when needed. She took the bird's advice, and in due time arrived at  the house of Locrinos. Luckily she only found his wife at home, who was  much struck by the Princess's youth and beauty and sweet gentle manners,  and still further impressed by the present of the shining pebble.  She readily let Fairer-than-a-Fairy have the fire, and in return for  the stone
