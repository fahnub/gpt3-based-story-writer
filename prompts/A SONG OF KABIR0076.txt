The village plans to torture and burn Messua and her husband for being the child's parents. The animals all agree to go ahead with the plan to destroy the fields of humans. Mowgli knows that the villagers will soon become dangerous, and that Buldeo will be coming in. Mowgli is telling a man and his wife that he is not a sorcerer, and that they should go into the jungle.

Hathi can but be angry at the worst, and  I would give a moon's hunting to hear a Master-word that compels the  Silent One."  He went away, leaving Mowgli
