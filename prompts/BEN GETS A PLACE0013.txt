Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes how a boy named Ben helps cure a patient with plantain leaves, and then plays with Freddie Firefly and Benjamin Bat. When Benjamin Bat vanishes, Freddie Firefly finds him and they have a conversation. The passage ends with two wanderers being made welcome by a mother and her daughters after they have washed themselves. Ben strokes Duke's nose and Duke nips him. Pat tells Ben to leave Duke alone and Ben says he's not afraid of Duke. Benjamin Bat and Freddie Firefly argue over whether Freddie has become too plump to eat. Benjamin thinks Freddie is plump enough to eat, but Freddie insists that he is not. Kiddie Katydid suggests that Mr. Frog and Freddie Firefly have a race after dark, but says he won't join in the fun until the night is almost gone. A gentleman is sitting and reading a paper when he notices some new arrivals. He speaks to them in a gruff tone, asking if a young tramp has been stealing their chickens. Mrs. Moss quickly assures him that it isn't the case, and proceeds to tell him about Ben's situation.

Last chunk: gentleman sat reading a paper, and peered over his  glasses at the new-comers with a pair of sharp eyes, saying in a testy  tone, which would have rather daunted any one who did not know what a  kind heart he had under his capacious waistcoat,--  "Good-morning, ma'am.  What's the matter now? Young tramp been stealing  your chickens?"  "Oh, dear no, sir!" exclaimed Mrs. Moss, as if shocked at the idea.  Then, in a few words, she told Ben's story, unconsciously making his  wrongs and destitution
