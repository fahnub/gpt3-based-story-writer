Outline: Buster Bumblebee is a young bee who is afraid of the Robber Fly, a fearsome creature that is said to lurk in the flower garden and clover field. When Buster's father is caught by the Robber Fly, the young bee is determined to find and confront the villain. After a long search, Buster finally finds the Robber Fly's lair and bravely faces him down. The Robber Fly is impressed by Buster's courage and decides to leave the area for good.

Story so far:  Buster Bumblebee was initially afraid of the Robber Fly, but over time he became less fearful and realized that the Fly was not a threat.

However, Buster boastfully claims that he isn't afraid of the robber fly and wishes he had gotten to see him. Buster's mother scolds him for being stupid.

Strange as it may seem, in spite of his cruel  beak, his long wings, and his spiny feet, he looked not a little as if he  might have been a near relation of Buster Bumblebee. Of
