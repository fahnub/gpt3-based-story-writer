Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Last chunk: sisters, and of  his nice little bed, and of the prayers his dear mamma used to hear him  say. He rose for the last time, and saw Nox standing on the bank, and  thought, "Now he has come to do something to me because I have so often  hurt him." Down, down he went, as a lark flew up in the summer sky. The  bird was almost out of sight when a soft black nose and great brown eyes  came close to his face, and a kind, gentle mouth took hold of him, and  paddling and swimming as hard as he could, Nox
