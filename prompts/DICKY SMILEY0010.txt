Outline: Dicky Smiley is an eight-year-old boy with a bright personality. His mother tries to call him Richard, after his father, but he resists and everyone ends up calling him Dicky. His father died in battle when he was very young, so his mother has to take care of him and his two sisters by herself. Dicky is a helpful boy and does whatever he can to make his mother's life easier.

One morning, his mother tells him that she wants to give him a present for being such a good helper. They count the money in his piggy bank and find that he has just enough to buy the toolbox he's been eyeing at the store. Dicky is thrilled and immediately runs out to buy it.

On his way to the store, he meets a little girl named Lola who is crying because her dog has been taken to the pound. Dicky sympathizes with her and agrees to help her get her dog back. They walk to the pound together and find that the dog will cost a dollar to release. Dicky only has 95 cents, so Lola offers to earn the rest by singing for him.

Dicky agrees and they go to the local park to sing. Bruno, Lola's dog, is a big hit with the crowd and they earn the final five cents quickly. They go back to the pound to get Bruno and the pound-man surprises them by giving them the dog for free.

Dicky and Lola are overjoyed and walk home together, Bruno running beside them. When they get back to their respective homes, Dicky's mother is surprised to see him with a dog but is even more proud of him when he tells her the story.

"Yes, indeed," answered the little girl, whose name was Lola. "I ran  behind the cart all the way to the pound. I cried after Bruno, and Bruno  whined for me, and poked his nose between the bars and tried to jump  out, but he couldn't. It's a pretty long way there, and the man is as  cross as two sticks."
