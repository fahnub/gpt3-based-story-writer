Story so far: The passage describes a meeting between the animals, in which they discuss how to kill the Devil-child (Mowgli). Bagheera tells Mowgli that he will have to go back to the humans eventually, but Mowgli insists that he is not ready yet. The passage also describes how Buldeo killed one of his own buffaloes after mistaking it for the Devil-child, and how the village plans to torture and burn Messua and her husband for being the child's parents.

Mowgli has killed Shere Khan and is now telling the Seeonee Pack that he will be hunting in the Jungle from now on.
