Outline: Jimmy Rabbit falls into a bog and calls for help, but Peter Mink pretends he can't hear him. Jimmy Rabbit finally gets his left hind-foot free and tries to pull himself out, but ends up sinking further in. Peter Mink finally comes over and Jimmy Rabbit bargains with him to get out, offering his left hind-foot in exchange. Peter Mink agrees but then tries to back out of the deal, so Jimmy Rabbit takes him to Mr. Crow to settle the matter.

Story so far: Jimmy Rabbit falls into some mud and gets stuck, but Peter Mink doesn't hear him. When Peter finally does find Jimmy, he scolds him for not following him in the first place. Jimmy Rabbit agrees to give Peter Mink his left hind-foot, on the condition that Peter must always carry it in his pocket and agree to take care of Jimmy's family if anything happens to him.

Last chunk: to laugh. "I don't see anything  funny about it," Peter Mink growled.  "Of course you don't," said Jimmy. "I didn't expect you to. And I don't  expect you're going to cut my foot off, because _you agreed not to_."  "I never did anything of the kind!" Peter Mink shouted.  "Well, we'll go and ask Mr. Crow what he thinks about it," Jimmy Rabbit  said. "We'll leave it to him."
