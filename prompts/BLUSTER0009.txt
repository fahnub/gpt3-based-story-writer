Last chunk: grumbled. "You never can tell  what they're going to do or what they're going to say. They may squawk  and cross the road; they may cross the road and not squawk; they may  squawk and not cross the road; they may not cross the road and not  squawk. I don't believe they know themselves what they are going to do  next."
