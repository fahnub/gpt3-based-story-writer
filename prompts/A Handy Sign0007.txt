Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is always being hunted by predators, so he decides to build a little hut near the fence between the meadow and the pasture. He hangs a sign outside his door that says "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow" on one side and "At Home. Don't Knock. Walk In" on the other.

One day, Tommy Fox sneaks up to Master Meadow Mouse's hut and sees the sign that says "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow." He decides to wait around and come back the next day.

The next day, Tommy Fox comes back and sees the sign that says "At Home. Don't Knock. Walk In." He sticks his nose through the doorway, but Master Meadow Mouse is nowhere to be found. Tommy Fox has been tricked by the clever Meadow Mouse and is very embarrassed.

Story so far:  The passage describes a creature that is annoyed at being tricked by a meadow mouse. It hopes that nobody ever finds out about the incident.

Last chunk: silly as anything.  "Fooled!" he growled. "Fooled by a Meadow Mouse! I hope nobody ever  finds it out."  [Illustration]      [Illustration]
