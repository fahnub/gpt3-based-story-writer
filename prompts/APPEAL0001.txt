Outline: Daphnis is in love with a woman who is apparently not interested in him. He weaves her webs of lies, hoping that she will eventually come to love him. However, the woman is not fooled and she eventually breaks off the relationship. Daphnis is heartbroken, but he eventually accepts that it was not meant to be.

Story so far:  The speaker implores their beloved not to lie to them, as even though they could forgive much, deceit would be too much to bear.

Last chunk: APPEAL (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)  .    Daphnis dearest, wherefore weave me    Webs of lies lest truth should grieve me?    I could pardon much, believe me:    Dower me, Daphnis, or bereave me,    Kill me, kill me, love me, leave me--    Damn me, dear, but don't deceive me!
