Outline: A long, long time ago, in the west of America, there lived an old man who had one son. The son and his friends used to spend their days hunting in the forest. One day, they went out as usual to hunt, but the leader of the group killed most of the animals. They started back for the village with their game, but the leader left his pack on the bank of the river and went home another way. When the old man went to get the pack, he drowned and was turned into a piece of wood. The wood floated downstream and was caught by a woman who used it as a table. When she tried to eat off the table, her food disappeared. The woman had a baby that grew very quickly into a man. The man restored the woman's sight and then left to go back to his own home. On the way, he stopped to eat dinner with two old women. He gave them his hair, which turned into a fishing net, and caught some salmon. The old women told him to go home, and he got in a basket and was lowered into a deep hole. He fell asleep and was drawn up by the old women. The man continued on his way and finally reunited with his family.

Story so far: A man is transported to a strange, yellow world where he find old women crushing their food between two stones. The old man went to the river to fetch the pack but drowned in the process. The woman found a baby instead of the plank she was looking for, and decided to take care of it. The baby quickly grew into a man, and was stronger than any of the other tribesmen. The father tells the little boy how he caught salmon in the Land of the Sun. A group of hunters kill a bunch of animals and then go home. Some salmon were leaping up a waterfall, and the narrator longed to catch some of them. He thought of using his hair as a line, and went to ask the old women for help. The passage describes a family being reunited after the father returns from a journey. The son is excited to see his father and the mother turns to look at him. They are all happy to be together again. A young man in a strange land finds an herb that can restore sight, and uses it to help two old women. Then he goes for a walk and finds a river. The man tells his son he will never go hungry, then leaves for home. It takes him a long time to get there, and when he does he's angry to see his son in his place. He goes into the forest and cries, each tear becoming a bird. The passage describes a man being drawn upwards by old women, who tell him he will never see his wife and son again unless he does as he is bid. The man is wise this time and holds on tight, eventually hearing a crow and springing out.
