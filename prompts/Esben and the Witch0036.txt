Story so far: A man named Esben is captured by a witch and put in a dark hole to fatten him up, but his daughter eventually grows to like her captor and decides not to kill him. The king gives Esben's brothers three days to bring him a marvellous boar, and Esben helps them. The three brothers escape the witch's house and ride to a king's palace, where they are hired as stablemen. Esben steals the witch's gold and silver boar, and she chases after him, asking if he also stole her dove and made her kill her children.
