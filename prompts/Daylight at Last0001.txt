Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

Story so far: The explorers find themselves at the bottom of a deep well with an Ork. The Ork is cheerful, but the humans are dismayed. They all wonder how they will get out. The Ork offers to carry the humans up the well, but they are afraid of falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork escapes the well and is relieved to be in the sunlight again. The Ork tells the humans that he will take them with him when he leaves the cave, and the humans express concern about falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork tells Trot and Cap'n Bill that it can fly out of the shaft using its mechanical propeller tail, and proceeds to do so. The Ork and Cap'n Bill have been walking through a tunnel for some time and Trot has been sleeping. Cap'n Bill wakes Trot up and they start walking again, hoping to find an exit.

Shall we go  on?" he asked.  "Of course," replied the Ork. "Unless this tunnel is different from  everything else in the world, and has no end, we'll find a way out of  it sooner or later."  The sailor gently wakened Trot. She felt much rested by her long sleep  and sprang to her feet eagerly.  "Let's start, Cap'n," was all she
