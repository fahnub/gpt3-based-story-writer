Outline: Henrietta Hen arrives at the fair and is disappointed that none of the other chickens seem to notice her. She soon meets a chicken who informs her that she will likely only win the third prize, which makes Henrietta feel discouraged. She begins to feel homesick and regrets coming to the fair.

Story so far:  Henrietta has a strong voice, which she uses to good effect when she arrives at the fair and is asked by another chicken what she is there for. She replies that she has come to get the first prize, having listened carefully to what Farmer Green and Johnnie had said to each other during the journey from the farm. Henrietta meet a lady in the next pen who has never heard of Pleasant Valley or Farmer Green, which shocks Henrietta since she assumed everyone knew of them. Henrietta Hen is offended when her neighbor says that Farmer Green can't be of much account, and she declares that she would never live anywhere but on his farm. Henrietta Hen feels left out when she arrives at the fair and nobody pays attention to her. Henrietta is disappointed that she did not win first prize in the contest she entered, and her new acquaintance tells her that not everyone can win every year.

"You aren't  homesick, are you?"  "N-no!" said Henrietta. "But I had expected to win the first prize. And I  don't know what my friends will say when I come back home without it."  "Well, everybody can't win it," said her new acquaintance. "Not the same  year, anyhow!" And then she looked Henrietta up and down
