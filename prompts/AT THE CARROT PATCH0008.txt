Outline: Nimble is a young deer who is determined to try carrots for himself, after his mother tells him how delicious they are. He sets off for the carrot patch one night, but is waylaid by Jimmy Rabbit, who is busy eating cabbages. Jimmy reluctantly shows Nimble to the carrot patch, and then scampers off.

Nimble is disappointed to find that carrots are not as tasty as he was led to believe. He starts to leave the patch, but is pursued by Jimmy Rabbit, who is being chased by a dog. Nimble and Jimmy lose each other in the woods, and Nimble goes home empty-handed.

The next day, Nimble's mother scolds him for not digging up the carrots to eat them, and he realizes his mistake. He insists that it wouldn't have made a difference anyway, because there was no moon out that night - a requirement for truly enjoying carrots, according to his mother.

Story so far:  Nimble is upset because he dug up carrots by moonlight, but then realizes that they wouldn't have tasted good anyway because there was no moon last night.
