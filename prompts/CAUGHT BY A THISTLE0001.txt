Outline: Peppery Polly Bumblebee is stuck to a thistle blossom and asks Freddie Firefly for help. Freddie tries to go get help from the Bumblebee family, but they are all sound asleep. He has to make a decision to either go back to the clover field and help Polly, or go to the firefly dance. He decides to go to the dance and forgets all about Polly. The next morning, Polly's friends help her get unstuck and she looks for Freddie the whole day. Freddie hides from her and avoids the clover field and flower garden for the rest of the summer.

Story so far:  Freddie Firefly goes to the Bumblebee family home in the meadow to get nectar and promises to bring a fellow worker back with him. Polly looks for Freddie Firefly after her friends set her free, but he stays hidden. After trying to rouse his family by knocking on the door, Freddie Firefly's efforts are in vain as they are all too deeply asleep. The family trumpeter later claims to have dreamt that she heard somebody at the door that night. A bee decides not to go back to a clover patch to keep a promise to another bee, and instead goes to a dance and has a good time. Peppery Polly's people, Freddie Firefly, grew discouraged and reflected that there were two things he could do. He could go back alone to the clover field and try to set that ill-tempered worker free--and no doubt get stung by her for his pains. Or he could go to the dance of the Fireflies over near the swamp, and have a delightful time. Freddie decided to go to the dance. The speaker is trying to convince Peppery Polly to let him go for help, since it would be too dangerous for him to try to free her from the quicksand himself. Peppery Polly is reluctant at first, but she eventually agrees. A bumblebee gets caught in a thistle, and a firefly tries to help her. The firefly points out that there is nectar in the thistle, but the bumblebee is still stuck.

"If you'd been a little less stingy with  that light of yours I wouldn't have made the mistake of thinking this  thistle was a clover blossom."  "Well, there's nectar in it, isn't there?" he inquired.  "I suppose so," she answered. "But I can't get it. And I'm so daubed  with the sticky stuff that's spread right where I put my feet that I  can't free
