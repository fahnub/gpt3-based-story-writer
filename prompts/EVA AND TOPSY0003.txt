Outline: Uncle Tom is a slave who lives with his owner, Mr. St. Clare, far away from his home. He is not really unhappy, but he longs to see his family again. His little mistress, Eva, becomes ill and Uncle Tom grows increasingly worried and sad. The doctor is called and Eva improves for a time, but then her health takes a turn for the worse.

However, she eventually became so unwell that even he had to admit that something was wrong, and the doctor was called.

And little Eva herself knew; but she was not troubled. She knew she was going to God.  'Papa' she said one day, 'there are some things I want to say to you. I want to say them now while I am able.'
