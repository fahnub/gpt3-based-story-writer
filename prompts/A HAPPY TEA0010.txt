Story so far: The passage describes three children's reactions to a fancy garden party. Betty is awestruck, Bab is resentful that her enemy Sally is not there to see her, and Ben is self-conscious but happy.

The slyness of the rascal tickled the boy so much that he pushed back  his hat, clapped his hands, and burst out laughing as he had not done  before for weeks. Every one looked round surprised, and Sancho regarded  them with a mildly inquiring air, as if he said, "Why this unseemly  mirth, my friends?"  Thorny forgot
