Outline: Andras Baive is a strong and swift Laplander who lives in Vadso. The people of Vadso are very proud of their champion, and think that he is the best runner in the world. However, they soon hear of another Laplander, Andras Baive, who is said to be even stronger and faster than their own champion.

The bailiff of Vadso challenges Andras to a race, with the stipulation that whoever can jump over an eight-oared boat without touching it with their heel will be the winner. Andras easily wins the race, much to the dismay of the bailiff.

The bailiff decides to get revenge on Andras by challenging him to a race across a fiord. However, Andras is able to use his magic powers to transform himself into a reindeer and easily outrun the bailiff.

The bailiff, who is really a Stalo (ogre), is mortally wounded in the race and asks Andras to promise to give him an honourable burial. Andras agrees, and also agrees to take anything he finds in the bailiff's house.

Andras sails across the fiord in the bailiff's boat and finds the bailiff's dog and son. He kills the dog, as it is known that if a Stalo's dog licks the blood of his dead master, the Stalo will come back to life. Andras takes the bailiff's treasure and gives it to his son before returning home.

He marries a rich wife and they live happily ever after.

Story so far:  Andras stumbles upon some wreckage and is happy to find that he can use it for something. Two men make a bet over who can jump over a boat without touching it. The winner gets a large sum of money. The passage describes a conversation between two people, in which one challenges the other to repeat a feat he has just accomplished. The second person is unable to do so, and the first chides him for his weakness. The passage describes a horse who transforms into a man, and then back into a horse again. He is on one side of a river, and the Stalo (a creature who is also on the other side of the river) is wondering how the horse will get to her. A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all living things, but not as swift as a Stalo. The bailiff, disguising himself as a Stalo, or ogre, called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras. The mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands, thinking of the new hut that he was. A man in Vadso is said to be faster than the bailiff. No one believes it, but when the man shows up one frosty day, the bailiff is eager to test his speed. The passage describes a man who jumps over a boat and is cheered by onlookers. The bailiff (a person who supervises an event) is taller than the man who jumped, and people are curious to see what he will do.

Last chunk: down to the sea.  An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play,and to hold the stakes, and Andras, as the stranger was told to jumpfirst.Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand tomark the starting place, he ran forward, with his head well thrownback, and cleared the boat with a mighty bound.The lookers- oncheered him, and indeed he well deserve it; but they waited anxiouslyall the same to see what the bailiff would do.On he came, taller thanAndras by
