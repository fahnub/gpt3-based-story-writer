Outline: Grunty Pig tells his mother he saw a bear, but she does not believe him. She punishes him for lying, but the next day he runs away again and is warned by the Muley Cow about bears. He does not believe her and stays in the pasture, but when it gets dark he is scared and goes home.

Story so far:  Grunty Pig is punished for running away and telling fibs, but he cannot resist the call of the fields and slips away again. Grunty Pig tells his mother that the bear that chased him was whitish with brown spots, had a long tail, and six legs. Mrs. Pig makes a strange noise, and Grunty Pig realizes that he described a dog, not a bear. The woman in the passage thinks that the man will change his tune when it gets dark. Grunty Pig has decided to stay in the pasture forever, and mocks the Muley Cow for trying to warn him about the bears. Mrs. Pig scolds her son, Grunty, for lying about seeing a bear. She then proceeds to physically discipline him. The passage tells the story of a animal who enjoys his holiday until he realizes he has been gone much longer than he planned. He doesn't want to go home because he knows his mother will be angry, so he decides not to go home at all.

Last chunk: fence. "I'll be back before she wakes  up," he chuckled.  In the garden, up the lane, through the pasture he made his way. And he  enjoyed his holiday to the full--until he remembered suddenly that he  had been gone a long time--a much longer time than he had planned to  spend away from the farmyard.  "Oh, dear!" he whined. "Mother must be awake now; and she'll punish me  if I go back." The more he thought about returning, the less he liked  the idea.  "I won't go home at all!" he cried at last.
