Outline: Baxter is a young boy who owns a billy-goat. The goat is very unique looking, with its two different-colored eyes and double-jointed legs. Baxter decides to take his goat to the local barber shop to get its head anointed (a process where the barber shaves the goat's head and applies a special oil to it).

The barber is initially hesitant to shave the goat's head, but Baxter is insistent. After the barber shaves the goat's head, he applies the oil and the goat immediately begins to look healthier and more vibrant. Baxter is very pleased with the results and thanks the barber for his help.

Story so far:  Baxter had a wall-eyed, double-jointed billy-goat that he took to the barber shop.
