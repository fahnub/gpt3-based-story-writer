Outline: Fairy Tenderheart is weeping because she can't stand the fighting she sees going on in the world. Her sisters try to comfort her, but she is inconsolable. She asks an older fairy why men fight, and is told that they just do, and that there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Fairy Tenderheart is determined to find a way to help, and sets off on a journey to find the Oldest Fairy of All, who might be able to help her.

She finally finds her in a Magic Garden, and the Oldest Fairy tells her that the only way to stop war is with the Plant of Knowledge, which has the power to turn people against war. They set off to plant the seeds of the Plant of Knowledge in children's gardens all over the world, in the hope that they will grow up to be a new generation who will scorn war.

Story so far:  The Oldest Fairy and her sister take their Plant of Knowledge to the children's gardens to spread the message of peace. Fairy Tenderheart is hopeful that the children who see the plant will never tread it in the mud. She plans to take seeds to all the children's gardens in the world. The passage is about a person who is sad that their work will not be complete for a long time. The Plant of Knowledge is the only thing that can end war, and the Oldest Fairy of All has planted it in many places.

Last chunk: as the sun and fragrant with a scent that stole upon the wind and made the heart heat high with happiness.  "This is the most beautiful," said Fairy Tenderheart.  "You have chosen well," said the Oldest Fairy of All. "You are fitted to help me in my work. That is the Plant of Knowledge; its crystal blossoms are called the Flowers of Understanding, and its fruit is Love. By it alone can war be made to cease."  She pointed far below. "I have planted it upon the earth in many spots," she said.
