Story so far:  Oswald and Dicky try to look through a hole in a flower pot on a window ledge to see coiners, but they don't see anything. The passage describes a boy named Albert who is waiting for a train with his uncle. His uncle tells him that the books he is reading are poorly translated and written in bad English. Albert disagrees, saying that they are still good stories. Alice is unconvinced by the justification for capital punishment, saying that she would be more interested in being a detective who catches criminals than in being a murderer herself. Alice's hero tries to retrieve something from a flower pot, but falls and hits his head on an iron pillar, rendering himself unconscious. The passage describes how the gate at the end of the next garden opened, and Dicky nudged Alice so that she would have fallen out of the tree if it had not been for Oswald's extraordinary presence of mind.

Last chunk: the house next door was as dark as dark. Then  suddenly we heard a sound--it came from the gate at the end of the  garden. All the gardens have gates; they lead into a kind of lane that  runs behind them. It is a sort of back way, very convenient when you  don't want to say exactly where you are going. We heard the gate at the  end of the next garden click, and Dicky nudged Alice so that she  would have fallen out of the tree if it had not been for Oswald's  extraordinary presence of mind.
