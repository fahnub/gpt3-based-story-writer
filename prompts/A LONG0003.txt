Outline: Ferdinand Frog meets a Great Blue Heron and is impressed by the size of his bill. The heron tells Ferdinand that he is moving into the area and Ferdinand is immediately worried that the heron will eat him. The heron reassures Ferdinand that he is not interested in eating frogs and the two become friends. Ferdinand is amazed by the heron's bill and says that it would be useful for making button-holes.

"'G. B.'!" Mr. Frog exclaimed, turning a pale green color. "What do  those letters stand for? Not Grizzly Bear, I hope!" He had heard  of--but had never seen--a Grizzly Bear; and for a moment he thought that  perhaps he had met one at last.  But the stranger soon set his fresh fears at rest.  "My full name," he
