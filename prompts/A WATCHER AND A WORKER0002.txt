Outline: Benny Badger is searching for a ground squirrel hole to dig when he finds one that is recent. He debates on whether or not to tell Mr. Coyote, his helper, and decides against it. Mr. Coyote, sly as he is, has been following Benny and calls out to him. They both know that the owner of the hole, the ground squirrel, is home. Benny offers to let Mr. Coyote dig while he watches, but Mr. Coyote insists that Benny should do the digging because he is better at it than Mr. Coyote. Benny agrees and starts to dig when Mr. Coyote moves a few steps away and says he will watch from the back door. Benny digs for a while, stopping every few minutes to listen for Mr. Coyote, but all he hears is a chuckle. Mr. Coyote is watching Benny dig while Benny tries to listen and dig at the same time.

Story so far:  Benny Badger is trying to catch a ground squirrel, but Mr. Coyote is following him. When Mr. Coyote suggests that the owner of the hole might be home, Benny generously offers to let Mr. Coyote dig for a while.

Last chunk: just begin digging and say nothing," he remarked to himself. "Andperhaps I can catch this Ground Squirrel without Mr. Coyote's help."  So he set to work. But he hadn't dug very far into the hole before heheard Mr. Coyote's voice close behind him. That sly fellow had beenfollowing him all the time.  "I hope the owner of this hole is at home," Mr. Coyote ventured.  At those words Benny Badger backed out of the hole and turned around.  "I'll let you dig a while," he said generously.  Mr. Coyote
