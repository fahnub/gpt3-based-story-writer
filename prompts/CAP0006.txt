Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

"No," replied Trot soberly, "I'm sure he does not expect us to be  happy here. But I'm going to fool him and have just as good a time  as I can." As she spoke they both turned around--an easy thing to do  with a single flop of their flexible tails--and Cap'n Bill uttered a  cry of surprise. Just across the room stood a
