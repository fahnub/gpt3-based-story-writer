Outline: The story is set in a poor, inner-city neighborhood, and revolves around the local Kindergarten. The protagonist is Patsy, a young boy who has been living a rough, tough life on the streets. Patsy is taken in by the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Kate, and quickly becomes devoted to her and the school. He takes on the role of caretaker and protector, and is a loyal and obedient student.

Patsy is also friends with Jim, another boy from the neighborhood. Jim is older than Patsy and is starting to get interested in girls. He tells Patsy that he wants to find a girl to marry, and Patsy helps him look.

One day, Patsy confides in Miss Kate that he is worried about what will happen to him when he has to leave the Kindergarten and go to "real school." Miss Kate reassures him and tells him that he is welcome to stay at the Kindergarten forever.

The story ends with Patsy and Jim getting married, and Miss Kate attending their wedding.

He doesn't come back until Christmas day. Johnnie Green and old dog Spot stumble upon some game, but Spot is oddly afraid to go after it. Patsy was a very prudent and proper young man, but he would only ever talk about his exciting adventures when he and his listener were alone. He had a stormy temper, but was learning to control it. Dickie Deer Mouse and Frisky Squirrel share many similarities, including their taste in homes and food. Dickie prefers nuts with thin shells because he is smaller than Frisky.

Last chunk: ever so far away!  In many other ways Dickie Deer Mouse was like Frisky Squirrel himself.  Dickie's idea of what a good home ought to be was much the same as  Frisky's: they both thought that the deserted nest of one of the big  Crow family made as fine a house as any one could want. And they  couldn't imagine that any food could possibly be better than nuts,  berries and grain.  To be sure, Dickie Deer Mouse liked his nuts to have thin shells. But  that was because he was smaller than Frisky;
