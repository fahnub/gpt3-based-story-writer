Outline: The Bumblebee family is out in the meadow when they notice a jug. Buster Bumblebee is curious about the jug and goes to investigate. He hears a roaring noise from inside the jug and tells the other bees that there is an enemy inside. The bees all fly into the jug and are subsequently captured by Johnnie Green. Johnnie takes the jug and shakes it, then sets it down and goes to get more water. The bees inside the jug start to stir and eventually fly out. They are disoriented and don't know what happened. The other bees blame Buster for the incident and are forever remarking on how lazy and stupid he is.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green is pleased after he corked a jug that held angry bumblebees, breaking up their home. Johnnie plans to drown all the stinging insects on his farm, but is unsure about mosquitoes. He pours the contents of the jug onto the ground, killing many bees in the process. Buster Bumblebee and the other workers mistake a jug for the enemy, and they buzz around it menacingly. The workers decided that the whole trouble was Buster's fault and started to treat him worse.

Last chunk: one point. They decided that somehow the whole trouble had been Buster's  fault--though they couldn't explain in just what way.  Anyhow, after that the workers looked on Buster with more disfavor than  ever. They were forever remarking how lazy and stupid he was. And even  the trumpeter was heard to declare that she was ashamed of him--though he  _was_ her own brother.
