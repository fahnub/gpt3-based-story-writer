Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes how Ben helps cure a patient with plantain leaves, then plays with Freddie Firefly and Benjamin Bat. When Benjamin Bat vanishes, Freddie Firefly finds him and they have a conversation. The passage ends with two wanderers being made welcome by a mother and her daughters after they have washed themselves. The boy in the passage was discouraged because the gate was locked, so he lay down outside. Mrs. Moss and the children were interested when he mentioned the gate. The boy then said that he saw the little girls playing inside while he was resting. The boy in the passage took a cake from the porch of the house while the owners were distracted by their dog. When confronted, the boy admitted to taking the cake and laughed about it. Ben finds a dinner pail and Mrs. Moss tells him it is hers. He is welcome to the bits his dog ran off with.

Last chunk: Sanch took it, and I'd like to  give it back if I knew whose it was," said Ben, bringing the new  dinner-pail out from the depths of the coach where he had gone to  housekeeping.  "That's soon done; it's mine, and you're welcome to the bits your queer  dog ran off with. Come along, I must lock up," and Mrs. Moss clanked her  keys suggestively.  Ben limped out, leaning on a broken hoe-handle, for he was stiff after  two days in such damp lodgings, as well as worn out with a fortnight's  wandering
