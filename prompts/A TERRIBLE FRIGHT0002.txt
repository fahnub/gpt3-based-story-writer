Outline: It was the night after old dog Spot had treed Fatty Coon in the big oak near the cornfield. They had finished their evening meal at Farmer Green's house. The cows were milked, the horses had been fed, the chickens had all gone to roost. And Farmer Green looked up at the moon, rising from behind Blue Mountain.

"We'll go coon-hunting again to-night," he said to Johnnie and the hired man. "The corn has brought the coons up from the swamp. We'll start as soon as it grows a little darker."

After a while, they set out for the cornfield. And sure enough! old Spot soon began to bark.

"He's treed!" said Farmer Green, pretty soon. And they all hurried over to the edge of the woods, where Spot had chased a coon up into a tall chestnut tree. In the moonlight, they could see the coon quite plainly.  "Another little feller!" cried Farmer Green. "I declare, all the coons that come to the cornfield seem to be young ones. This one's no bigger than the one we saw last night."

It was Fatty Coon who was up there in the tall chestnut. He had run almost to the woods this time, before he had to take to a tree. In fact, if Spot hadn't been quite so close to him, Fatty could have reached the woods, and then he would have just jumped from one tree to another. But there were no trees near enough the big chestnut for that. Fatty had to stay right there and wait for those men to pass on. He wasn't afraid. He felt perfectly safe in his big tree. And he only smiled when Johnnie Green said to his father,

"I wish I had that young coon. He'd make a fine pet."

"A pet!" exclaimed Farmer Green. "You remember that pet fox you had, that stole my chickens?"

"Oh, I'd be careful," Johnnie promised. "Besides, don't you think we ought to catch him, so he won't eat any more corn?"

Farmer Green smiled. He had been a boy himself, once upon a time, and he had not forgotten the pet coon that he had owned when he was just about Johnnie's age.

Story so far:  Farmer Green never guessed that it was Fatty Coon who was up in the tall chestnut. Fatty had run almost to the woods before he had to take to a tree. If Spot hadn't been quite so close to him, Fatty could have reached the woods and just jumped from one tree to another. But there were no trees near enough the big chestnut for that, so Fatty had to stay and wait for the men to pass. Farmer Green, Johnnie and the hired man go coon-hunting. The tree is shaking and Fatty Coon is wrapped around a limb, hanging on tight. A boy named Johnnie Green wants to catch a young raccoon so he can keep it as a pet, but Farmer Green reminds him of the time when Johnnie had a pet fox that stole Farmer Green's chickens. Johnnie's father agrees to let him keep a raccoon, on the condition that it doesn't kill any of the farm's poultry. Johnnie promises to take care of it, and his father and the hired man begin chopping down the tree it's in. Farmer Green and his companions set out for the cornfield, where Spot soon began barking. They soon found that he had treed a coon, which they could see in the moonlight. Green commented that all the coons that came to the cornfield lately seemed to be young ones.
