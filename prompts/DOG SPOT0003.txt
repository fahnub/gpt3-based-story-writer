Outline: Grunty Pig insists that his tail is the most beautiful in the neighborhood, but old dog Spot points out that it would be more convenient if it were nailed to the outside of the barn.

Spot tells him that he has seen plenty of pigs without tails and they looked just fine. Grunty Pig listens carefully but is still unsure.

Really, they looked better without tails  than they would have looked with them."  Grunty Pig had listened carefully to what Spot said. Yet somehow he  couldn't quite make
