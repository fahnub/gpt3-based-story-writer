Outline: Farmer Green has a pair of oxen, Bright and Broad, who are very strong but quite slow. Twinkleheels, Farmer Green's pony, is much faster but not nearly as strong. The bays in the barnyard tell Twinkleheels that Bright and Broad are actually quite fast and could easily beat him in a race. Twinkleheels doesn't believe them and challenges the oxen to a race. Bright and Broad agree, but when Twinkleheels asks them if the bays were telling the truth, they simply say that he hasn't asked them a question yet. Twinkleheels is surprised and asks them if they're actually faster than he is. They confirm that they are, and Twinkleheels is shocked. The oxen explain that they're often called upon to do things that require a lot of strength but not much speed, like pulling a heavy load or wagon out of a mud hole. Twinkleheels decides not to race them after all, realizing that he would never be able to win.

Story so far:  The speaker is surprised to learn that the people he is talking to know about him. The passage describes how Twinkleheels spoke to some cows, who listened with a dreamy look in their eyes. Twinkleheels paused, expecting them to speak, but they said nothing. Finally, Twinkleheels asked them a question, to which they replied that they hadn't been asked a question. Farmer Green has a pair of oxen, Bright and Broad, who are very different from his pony, Twinkleheels. Bright and Broad are huge and slow-moving, and they never frisk or play like Twinkleheels does. When they do move faster than a walk, they lurch into a strange, shambling swing that makes Twinkleheels giggle.

Last chunk: BRIGHT AND BROAD (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    Farmer Green had a yoke of oxen called Bright and Broad. They were huge,  slow-moving fellows, as different from Johnnie Green's pony,  Twinkleheels, as any pair could be. They never frisked about in the  pasture. They never ran, nor jumped, nor kicked. They seldom even  trotted. And when they did move faster than a walk they lurched into a  queer, shambling swing.  The first time Twinkleheels saw them travelling at that gait he couldn't  help giggling.
