Outline: One night, Fatty Coon is strolling along the road when he is almost caught by a monster. The monster is fast and Fatty is only able to escape by jumping to the side of the road. The monster then runs away up the hill.

Fatty Coon hurries home to tell his mother about his escape. His mother is excited and they both climb to the top of a poplar tree to see the monster. The monster is at Farmer Green's house and after a short conversation with Farmer Green, the monster drives away.

Fatty and his mother watch the monster as it drives down the valley and then they know it is gone. Fatty asks his mother if the monster ate Farmer Green and his family and she says she hopes so.

Story so far:  The creature's scary screech made Fatty jump to the side of the road, just in time. The creature then ran up the hill, so fast that it seemed to be panting. Fatty Coon is walking home from the orchard, where he ate his fill of apples. He takes his time, enjoying the quiet night. Suddenly, he is confronted by a monster. A mother and her child watch as a monster dashes down the valley. The child is frightened and asks if the monster ate up Farmer Green and his family. The mother hopes so, as it would mean fewer traps in the woods.

Last chunk: mother watched the monster dash down  the valley. They knew he had gone, because they could see the gleam of  those awful eyes.  "Do you suppose he ate up Farmer Green and his family?" Fatty asked in a  frightened voice.  "I hope so," she said. "Then perhaps there'll be no more traps in the  woods."  "But who would plant the corn?" Fatty asked.  Mrs. Coon did not appear to hear his question.
