Outline: Timothy Turtle is a wild creature who lives in Pleasant Valley. He occasionally goes on excursions to different parts of the valley, but always returns to Black Creek. The other animals in the valley do not particularly like Timothy, as he is grumpy and never works.

One day, Timothy arrives in the Beaver colony and announces that he will be staying for a week. The Beavers are not pleased, as they are busy creatures who do not like Timothy's lazy ways. However, Grandaddy Beaver reminds them that Timothy has been to the colony before and has never harmed anyone.

 Brownie Beaver, a young member of the colony, thinks that somebody should make Timothy Turtle mend his ways. He believes that Timothy is old enough to know better than to be so lazy.

Story so far:  The beavers are not happy that Timothy Turtle is coming to stay with them, as he is lazy and does not do any work. They all go to Grandaddy Beaver to ask him what to do. Grandaddy Beaver was a wise old soul, and he advised the younger members of the colony to stay calm. He told them about Timothy Turtle, who had visited the pond many years before and had been a perfect gentleman during his stay.

Last chunk: Grandaddy was a good old soul. And he told the hot-headed younger  members of the colony to keep cool, which seems a simple thing for them  to have done, swimming about as they were in the icy water, which  flowed down from springs on the side of Blue Mountain.  "Timothy Turtle has been here before," Grandaddy Beaver announced. "I  can remember my great-grandfather's telling me about his passing two  whole weeks in our pond. And though everybody wished he would leave, he  never harmed anybody,
