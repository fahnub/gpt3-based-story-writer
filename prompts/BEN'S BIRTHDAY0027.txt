Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A competition is underway to win a silver arrow. Ben and Bab are two of the best marksmen, but when the old lady catches Ben's jacket and begins questioning him, it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard. The monkey is freed from his uniform and given food by the young master. Ebenezer used to race at the county fair, and he always won. The Muley Cow says Ebenezer was known as the fastest animal around. The passage describes a young boy who has been sleeping in a woman's barn for two nights. He is tired and has nowhere else to go. The woman is surprised but sympathetic. The passage is about a girl who is happy for her friends even though she herself did not win a prize.

Last chunk: though for an  instant she could not help wishing that the cry had been "Bab's beat!  Hurrah!" it sounded so pleasant. Then she saw Ben's beaming face,  Thorny's intense relief, and caught the look Miss Celia sent her over  the heads of the boys, and decided, with a sudden warm glow all over her  little face, that losing a prize did sometimes make one happier than  winning it. Up went her best hat, and she burst out in a shrill, "Rah,  rah, rah!" that sounded very funny coming all alone after
