Outline: Freddie Firefly and Peppery Polly Bumblebee are flying towards a clover field in the darkness. Freddie is alarmed by Peppery Polly's song, which is full of threats to sting anyone who tries to trick her. When they reach the clover field, Polly begins to collect nectar from the flowers. Freddie Firefly tricks her by pointing out a "big blossom" that is actually a thistle. Polly is angry and tries to sting Freddie, but she is in too much pain from the thistle and can't. Freddie Firefly is surprised that Polly doesn't try to sting him and soon realizes that she is in some kind of trouble.

Story so far:  The person is in some kind of trouble. Freddie Firefly is relieved when Peppery Polly Bumblebee seems pleased with his flattery. They settle down in a field of red clover, where Polly starts sucking up nectar with her long tongue. She doesn't speak for some time, since her tongue is buried deep in the clover blossom. Freddie Firefly tricks Peppery Polly by pointing out a clover blossom to her. When she goes to taste it, she realizes it's a thistle and gets pricked.

Last chunk: trick on her.  "Here's a big blossom you haven't tasted!" he called to her suddenly.  And Peppery Polly--thinking that Freddie meant a clover  blossom--hastened to a bloom that Freddie pointed out to her.  She settled upon it quickly. And the next moment Peppery Polly gave a  sharp cry of mingled rage and pain.  "What's the matter?" Freddie Firefly asked her.  "Matter!" she exclaimed. "It's a thistle--and I've pricked myself  badly."  "Why, so it is a thistle blossom!" said Freddie Firefly.
