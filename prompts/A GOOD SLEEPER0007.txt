Outline: Twinkleheels is a young horse who is annoyed with his neighbor, Ebenezer, an old horse who is always falling asleep. Twinkleheels is determined to teach Ebenezer a lesson by racing him and showing him how fast he can go. However, Ebenezer is a very experienced horse and easily defeats Twinkleheels. Afterwards, Ebenezer explains to Twinkleheels that he is successful because he always pays attention and mind his own business - something that Twinkleheels still has to learn.

He says that even at his age, he is still learning new things. His young neighbor, Twinkleheels, says that Ebenezer has not learned anything new today because he has been dozing all day.
