Outline: Nimble, a deer, is out foraging for food when he happens upon the cave where he had waited for Cuffy Bear weeks before. He remembers how he had fed upon the green things under the snow and begins to paw away the snow to find more food.

Cuffy Bear, who had been inside the cave sleeping, wakes up and comes out to find Nimble. At first, Cuffy doesn't recognize Nimble because he has shed his horns since they last met. But once Cuffy realizes who Nimble is, he is surprised to see him because he had assumed Nimble would have left long ago.

Nimble tells Cuffy that he only stayed because he heard old dog Spot coming. Cuffy is relieved to hear this and the two animals go their separate ways.

Story so far:  Cuffy Bear and Nimble meet again after a long time apart. Cuffy Bear is surprised to see how much Nimble has changed, and Nimble points out that Cuffy Bear has changed too - he looks much hungrier. They decide to walk down the mountain together.

You have changed a great deal  since I left you here."  "And you--" Nimble told him--"you have changed too."  "I have?" Cuffy Bear cried. "How's that? How have I changed?"  "You look much hungrier," Nimble explained.  Cuffy Bear laid a paw across his waistcoat.  "I _am_ hungry," he admitted. "And if you're going down the mountain I  think I'll stroll along with you
