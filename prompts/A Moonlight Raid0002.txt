Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is enjoying a party in the cornfield when they spot Fatty Coon approaching and everyone scatters. Master Meadow Mouse runs to his shock and curls up in his nest to try and take a nap. He feels safe since Mr. Crow has been visiting the cornfield everyday and has never bothered anyone.

Fatty Coon starts raiding the corn field, and Master Meadow Mouse complains each time he is woken up by the noise. Eventually, Fatty Coon tears down the entire shock that Master Meadow Mouse is hiding in and he is forced to flee. Fatty Coon catches him and eats him.

Story so far:  Master Meadow Mouse is trying to sleep, but is disturbed by Fatty Coon. Fatty Coon is only washing his ear of corn before he eats it. Fatty Coon pulled three ears of corn from the shock, devouring them each greedily. The third time he paused, cocking his ear towards the top of the shock. Fatty Coon does not intend to leave soon. He begins to pull at the cornstalks with his claws, despite Farmer Green's attempts to bind them together. This causes alarm for Master Meadow Mouse. A coon is looking for a meadow mouse, and the mouse is hiding in a cornstalk castle. The mouse says he won't come out until the coon goes away. The Meadow Mouse party vanishes when they hear that Fatty Coon is coming. Master Meadow Mouse runs to his nest inside a corn shock and falls asleep. He feels safe because old Mr. Crow comes to the cornfield every day. Mr. Crow had eaten corn, but he hadn't bothered anybody. Master Meadow Mouse thought that as soon as Fatty Coon had stuffed himself with corn he would stroll back to Cedar Swamp. Master Meadow Mouse had fallen into a doze when a sharp rustle waked him.

And now Master Meadow Mouse thought that as  soon as Fatty Coon had stuffed himself with corn he would stroll back to  Cedar Swamp.  Master Meadow Mouse had fallen into a doze when a sharp rustle waked  him.  "Ho, ho!" he chuckled. "There's Fatty Coon now! He's pulling an ear of  corn off my shock. Well, I don't believe I'll miss it. There's corn  enough in this
