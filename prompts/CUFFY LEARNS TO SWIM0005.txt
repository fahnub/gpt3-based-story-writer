Outline: Cuffy Bear is floating down the river on a cake of ice. He is huddled up in a little black heap in the center of the cake, and crying as if his heart would break. Cuffy is worried that he will never see his mother and father and Silkie again. If only he knew how to swim, like his father! But he doesn't; and there he is, being swept away down the valley, right toward Farmer Green's house.

When Cuffy thinks about Farmer Green he is more frightened than ever and he begins to scream. He remembers all the dreadful things he has heard about men and the things they do to little bears.

Pretty soon Cuffy sees something move up on the bank ahead of him. And he stops screaming. He is afraid that it is Farmer Green himself and he thought he had better keep still. Then perhaps Farmer Green wouldn't see him. But to his dismay the big black thing begins to slide down the steep bank right toward the river.

Cuffy's heart seems to stand still. He shut his eyes tight and tried to make himself as small as he could. And he hardly breathed.

Then somebody called his name. Cuffy was so surprised that he looked up, and there was his father standing on the edge of the stream. Cuffy was _so_ glad to see him!

Mr. Bear seemed very cross, but Cuffy did not mind that, he was _so_ glad to see his father.

"Oh, Father! What shall I do?" Cuffy cried.

Mr. Bear said just one word. It was _"Jump!"_

Cuffy could hardly believe his ears.

_"Jump!"_ said Mr. Bear again.

"I don't know how to swim," Cuffy whined.

_"Jump, jump, jump!"_ Mr. Bear repeated very sternly.

Still Cuffy did not jump. He was so afraid of that rushing water!

Then Mr. Bear became very, very angry. He gave a great roar and plunged into the icy water. With a few strong strokes--for Mr. Bear was a fine swimmer--he reached the middle of the river. And as he swam close up to Cuffy he reached out and gave that naughty, frightened little bear a shove that sent him flying into the stream.

Story so far:  Cuffy is out in the woods when he sees a big black thing sliding down the bank toward the river. He shuts his eyes tight and tries to make himself as small as he can. Then somebody calls his name, and he is surprised to see his father standing there. Cuffy Bear is floating on a cake of ice down a river, wishing he had stayed at home. He is crying because he thinks he will never see his mother and father again. If only he knew how to swim! Cuffy is punished and has to go to bed, but he can hear his parents laughing in the next room. He doesn't think it's funny that he floated down the river on a cake of ice. A swimmer pushed a bear into a river, and the bear had to swim back up to breath.

And as he swam close up to  Cuffy he reached out and gave that naughty, frightened little bear a  shove that sent him flying into the stream.  Cuffy started to scream. But his shriek was cut off short as he sank,  head and all, into the cold, cold river. In another moment his nose came  up out of the water. It was only an instant, but to Cuffy it seemed a  long, long time before he could breathe again. And now, to his great  surprise, he
