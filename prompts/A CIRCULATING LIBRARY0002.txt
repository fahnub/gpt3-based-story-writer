Story so far: Ben and his dog are newcomers in a small town. The town's children are excited by their presence and follow them around. Ben and his dog are always together, and the children think they are a great team. The passage describes someone who is very acrobatic and skilled at performing tricks on the balls that decorate the posts of a lantern frame. Betty is waiting for her parents to come home, and she is impatient because she wants to continue reading about the new arrival, a dog named Sancho. Bab says that they can have fun with Sancho by learning the signs he uses to communicate.

It's sundown, and I heard the cows mooing, so I  know they have gone home," said Betty, impatiently; for she regarded the  new-comer in the light of an entertaining book, and wished to read on as  fast as possible.  "I'm going to learn the signs he makes when he wants Sancho to dance;  then we can have fun with him whenever we like. He's the dearest dog I  ever saw!" answered Bab,
