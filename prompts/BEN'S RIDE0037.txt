Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

"Hold on," he added, as Ben made one leap  to Lita's back. "You'll have to go to Berryville. Dr. Mills is a master  hand for broken bones and old Dr. Babcock ain't. 'Tisn't but about three  miles from here to his house, and you'll fetch him 'fore there's any  harm done waitin'."  "Don't kill Lita," called Miss Celia from the cart, as it began to move.
