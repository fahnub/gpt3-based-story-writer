Mrs. Robin manages to feed her children and the young Cowbird in her nest. The passage describes how Brer Rabbit got covered in mud while being chased by Brer Dust, but was able to clean himself off while the other animals were still covered in mud.

Mr. Frog exclaimed, buttoning the long coat which he had donned before  going out of doors. "I wish they'd hurry up!" he added mysteriously. He  kept a close watch upon his shop door. It was evident that he expected  callers.  Not long afterward a crowd began to gather in front of Mr. Frog's door.  "Back Soon" said the sign upon it.
