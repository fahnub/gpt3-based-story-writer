Outline: Tom Tinker is a little boy who loves his dog, Caesar. Caesar is a loyal and playful companion who always follows Tom around. One day, when Tom is out playing in the park, he sees a big dog and runs over to pet him. The big dog's owner tells Tom to be careful, but he doesn't listen and gets too close. The big dog growls and snaps at Tom, causing him to fall and hurt his leg. Tom starts to cry, and Caesar runs over to him, barking and licking his face. The big dog's owner scoops Tom up and takes him to the park ranger's office, where they call Tom's parents. Tom's parents come to the park and take him home, but not before scolding him for getting too close to the big dog. They tell him that he needs to be more careful in the future. Tom agrees and promises to be more careful, but he knows that he can always count on Caesar to protect him.
