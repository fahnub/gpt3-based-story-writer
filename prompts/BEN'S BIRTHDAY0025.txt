Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes how Ben helps cure a patient with plantain leaves, then plays with Freddie Firefly and Benjamin Bat. When Benjamin Bat vanishes, Freddie Firefly finds him and they have a conversation. The passage ends with two wanderers being made welcome by a mother and her daughters after they have washed themselves. The boy in the passage was discouraged because the gate was locked, so he lay down outside. Mrs. Moss and the children were interested when he mentioned the gate. The boy then said that he saw the little girls playing inside while he was resting. The boy in the passage took a cake from the porch of the house while the owners were distracted by their dog. When confronted, the boy admitted to taking the cake and laughed about it. Ben finds a dinner pail and Mrs. Moss tells him it is hers. He is welcome to the bits his dog ran off with. Benjy is a naughty, disagreeable boy who is always cloudy, smudgy, and slovenly. The boys are disappointed to learn that the dog they found is not theirs, but Ben suggests that the dog may be his, since he is the same color as Ben's old horse. The girls are determined to beat Ben in archery, and Thorny is encouraging him to do his best. Ben is feeling the pressure, but he's determined to win.

Last chunk: the girls as  Thorny announced it before he hurried back to Ben, whispering anxiously,--  "Steady, old Man, steady; you must beat that, or we shall never hear the  last of it."  Ben did not say, "She won't get ahead of me," as he had said at the  first; he set his teeth, threw off his hat, and, knitting his brows with  a resolute expression, prepared to take steady aim, though his heart  beat fast and his thumb trembled as he pressed it on the bowstring.  "I hope you'll beat, I truly do," said
