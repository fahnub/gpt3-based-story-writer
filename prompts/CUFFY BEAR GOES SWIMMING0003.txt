Outline: Cuffy Bear is being chased by bees and he runs to the brook to escape them. He jumps into the pool in the middle of the brook, but the bees follow him and keep stinging him. Cuffy has to keep his head underwater to avoid them, but he gets tired and has to come up for air. He tries to hide in a shallow part of the pool, but the bees find him and keep stinging him. Cuffy stays in the pool until sundown when the bees finally leave. He is very cold and his face feels like it's on fire, but he makes his way home.

Story so far:  Cuffy the rabbit is trying to escape a swarm of bees by jumping into a pool of water. The bees know they will drown if they follow, so they wait in a swarm above the water. Cuffy Bear rushes to the deep pool in the forest to watch the trout. On the way, he stops to bury his face in the leaves, but the bees bother him. Cuffy got tired from all the swimming, so he found a shallow place to stand where he could poke his nose out for fresh air. Cuffy is numb and cold, but his face feels like it's on fire. He can hardly see, but he's picking his way through the forest. Cuffy is being chased by bees, and every time he comes up for air, they are there waiting for him.

Last chunk: and waited. And when, after a  moment, Cuffy's head came up out of the pool, they swooped down and  began to sting him again.  Cuffy promptly ducked his head. And he swam under water to the further  side of the pool and came up once more. To his surprise the bees were  right there waiting for him. And he ducked under again, and swam to the  opposite side, near the big boulder. And once more, when he came up to  breathe, he found the buzzing bees all ready to pounce upon his nose.  So poor Cuffy
