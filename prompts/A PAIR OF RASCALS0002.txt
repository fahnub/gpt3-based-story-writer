Outline: Mr. Frog is a tailor who lives by a creek. One day, he sees Mr. Crow flying overhead and calls out to him. Mr. Crow is on his way to the cornfield and doesn't want to stop, but Mr. Frog insists that he has important news.

Mr. Frog tells Mr. Crow that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler and that's how he makes his famous "Katy did, Katy" song. Mr. Crow is unimpressed and tells Mr. Frog that he won't be spreading this news around.

Mr. Frog is disappointed but Mr. Crow is unmoved. He tells Mr. Frog that he's not going to tell Brownie Beaver about the news either, because they've had a disagreement. Mr. Crow flies off to the cornfield and Mr. Frog is left alone.

The tailor tells Mr. Crow that the reason the frogs keep croaking "Katy did, Katy" all night is because a young frog is courting his daughter. Mr. Crow is horrified at this news and vows not to tell Brownie Beaver about it. A frog and a crow have a disagreement, and the crow is no longer the frog's newspaper. The frog asks the crow to mention him when telling the story of what happened, as he was the one who discovered the secret. The tailor sees Mr. Crow and calls out to him. Mr. Crow comes over and Mr. Frog tells him he has some news. Mr. Crow says the news will have to wait, as he is on his way to the distance.

Last chunk: the distance.  "There he is!" cried the tailor aloud. "There's the old boy! He'll be in  sight in a moment."  And sure enough! soon Mr. Crow flapped out of the woods and came sailing  over the meadows.  Thereupon Mr. Frog set up a great croaking. And to his delight his  elderly friend heard him calling and dropped down at once.  "I've some news for you," Mr. Frog announced, as soon as the old black  scamp alighted near him.  "It'll have to keep," Mr. Crow replied. "I'm on my way to the
