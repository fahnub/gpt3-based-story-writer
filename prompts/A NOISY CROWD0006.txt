Outline: A crowd of animals has gathered at Farmer Green's house to watch the races and other sports that have been organized by Benjamin Bat. Among the crowd is Mr. Frog, who is trying to be the center of attention and is objecting to every arrangement that Benjamin has made.

Kiddie Katydid is hiding among the leaves, listening to the conversations and occasionally talking to the other animals. When Mr. Frog suggests a swimming contest, Kiddie objects, saying that he would drown himself. Everybody laughs at Mr. Frog, who then goes to hide in the watering trough.

Benjamin Bat is having trouble finding anyone who is willing to participate in the contest of hanging upside down by their heels. When he asks Kiddie Katydid, Kiddie declines. Benjamin becomes angry and threatens to eat Kiddie if he doesn't participate. Kiddie remains silent and hopes that Benjamin will go away and get a good meal before coming back.

Story so far:  Mr. Frog and Kiddie are discussing a swimming contest. Kiddie is hesitant because he is not a strong swimmer, but Mr. Frog reassures him that he can stick his head under water so he won't hear what people say if he loses. Mr. Frog, the tailor, is trying to manage the wholeaffair and objects to every arrangement that Benjamin Bat has made. Mr. Frog and Kiddie Katydid have a conversation about jumping, with Kiddie Katydid insisting that he is not worried about Mr. Frog beating him. Kiddie Katydid then hides among the leaves, where he can listen to people and talk to them when he wants to. Kiddie Katydid is being chased by Benjamin Bat and wishes that he would just go away and get a good meal somewhere.

Last chunk: declared, peering among the maple  leaves--"if I could see you I'd show you how it feels to hang beneath a  limb."  Kiddie Katydid said no word in reply. He knew well enough what Benjamin  Bat meant. Benjamin wanted to eat him! And he wished that Benjamin would  go away and get a good meal somewhere before he came back again.
