Outline: Nimble, a young fawn, sneaks away from his mother while she's sleeping and into the woods. He's careful not to make any noise and disturb her. As he's exploring, he comes across a fox perched in a tree. He's never seen a fox before, but he knows they're supposed to be sly creatures with bushy tails and long, pointy noses. He stares at it for a moment before realizing that it's actually a raccoon.

He hurriedly runs back to his mother to tell her what he saw. She's relieved that it was just a raccoon and not a fox, but scolds him for wandering off into the woods by himself. She teaches him that foxes are actually red, with no rings on their tails, and they don't climb trees. Nimble is glad to learn this and is also glad that his mother didn't ask him how he ended up in the woods alone.

Story so far:  The creature in the passage is a deer, and the protagonist is a mother deer who is trying to protect her fawn. She is startled and looks around for her fawn, but does not see it anywhere. The mother had not asked the son how he got lost in the woods. Nimble's mother tells him that the fox he saw was actually a raccoon, and Nimble is glad to learn the difference.

And he was glad, too,
