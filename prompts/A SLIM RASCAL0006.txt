Outline: Solomon Owl sets out to tell Mr. Crow that he is mistaken about Grumpy Weasel being able to fill knot holes at the sawmill. He explains that Grumpy Weasel is too active to do such a thing. Mr. Crow gets angry and tells Solomon Owl that he is the one who is mistaken. He says that Grumpy Weasel is too short-tempered to be welcome anywhere.

Story so far:  Solomon blundered away into the woods after a failed retort to Mr. Crow. Grumpy Weasel is quick, as evidenced by his ability to vanish before your eyes. Mr. Crow believes that Grumpy Weasel would be more useful if he filled knot holes at the sawmill, but Solomon Owl tells him that he is mistaken. Grumpy Weasel has the shortest temper of all the animals in the forest. He is so irritable that even Peter Mink is not as short-tempered as he is. Grumpy Weasel was not welcome because he was mean.

Last chunk: woods that he was out hunting, all the small people kept  quite still, because they were afraid. And even some of the bigger  ones--a good deal bigger than Grumpy Weasel himself--felt uneasy.  So you can see whether or not Grumpy Weasel was welcome.
