Outline: Eliza overhears her master, Mr. Shelby, and his wife discussing the sale of her young son, Harry, and decides to take matters into her own hands. She bundles up the child and flees in the night, headed for the home of her husband, George. Along the way, she is met by her friend and fellow slave, Uncle Tom, who tells her that he too has been sold and is to be collected the following day.

Eliza continues on to George's home, where she finds him packing his belongings in preparation for his own escape. She convinces him to take her and Harry with him, and the three set off into the night.

As they travel, they are pursued by men sent by Mr. Shelby to retrieve them. In a moment of desperation, Eliza crosses a frozen river with Harry in her arms, managing to reach the other side just as the ice begins to give way. The men pursuing them are forced to turn back, and Eliza and her family are safe.

Story so far:  Tom and Aunt Chloe are discussing Eliza's decision to escape with her son. Tom says that he understands why she is doing it, and Aunt Chloe suggests that he come with them. Tom says that he cannot, because he has been trusted by his master and he cannot betray that trust. Eliza tells Tom and Aunt Chloe that they have been sold and that the man who bought them is coming to take them away the next day. Tom is devastated, and Aunt Chloe wonders what they could have done to deserve this. However, Eliza explains that it is not anything they have done, but rather that the man their master owes money to is demanding payment in the form of Tom and Chloe.

Last chunk: sold him,' said Eliza. 'I heard master tell missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom. The man is coming to take you away to-morrow.'  At first Tom could hardly believe what he heard. Then he sank down, and buried his face in his hands.  'The good Lord have pity on us!' said Aunt Chloe. 'What has Tom done that master should sell him?'  [Illustration]  'He hasn't done anything--it isn't for that. Master don't want to sell; but he owes this man money. If he doesn't pay him it will end
