Outline: Benny Badger is out hunting for Ground Squirrels when he comes across Mr. Fox. They chat for a bit, and Benny notices that Mr. Fox is very sly and doesn't say much. Benny decides to make him talk next time they meet.

The next day, Benny meets Mr. Fox again and asks him about birds' eggs. Mr. Fox tries to avoid the question, but Benny persists. Mr. Fox finally tells Benny to ask a Prairie Chicken about eggs, and Benny goes off in search of one.

Mr. Fox chuckles to himself, knowing that the Prairie Chickens won't tell Benny anything.

Story so far:  Benny Badger questions Mr. Fox on where he has been finding birds' eggs. Mr. Fox deflects the question and tells Benny to ask a Prairie Chicken instead. Benny and Mr. Fox talk about eggs, and Mr. Fox gives Benny the idea to look for a Prairie Chicken. Benny says goodbye and sets off to find one. Benny Badger decides to ask Mr. Fox some questions, since their conversations always seem one-sided. He next sees Mr. Fox at a Ground Squirrel's hole, and notices that Mr. Fox is interested in it. Benny Badger was alarmed when he saw Mr. Fox in danger, but he relaxed when he saw that Mr. Fox was okay. Mr. Fox was amused by the whole situation, while Benny was left wondering what had happened.

Last chunk: violently thatBenny Badger was quite alarmed.  He waited anxiously until he saw that Mr. Fox was out of danger. Andthen he left him.  If he had looked back he might have seen his sly friend capering aboutin the gray light as if something amused him hugely. And no doubt Bennywould have wondered what it could have been.  "Prairie Chickens!" Mr. Fox was chuckling. "Much they'll tell _him_about eggs!"
