Outline: Mrs. Ladybug's friends miss her after she goes into the farmhouse to stay for the winter. They spread rumors that she is back, and sure enough, she is. However, she is acting strange and will not answer any questions about her winter stay. Her friends try to get her to tell them what happened, but she refuses. Finally, Buster Bumblebee makes a blundering comment and Mrs. Ladybug finally tells them that she and Mrs. Green did not get along well together.

Story so far:  The neighbors question the woman why she spent only a few days in Farmer Green's house instead of the whole winter. Ladybug's neighbors laugh at her, and she ends up confessing that she didn't get along with Mrs. Green.

Last chunk: Ladybug's neighbors couldn't help tittering. And somehow their  amusement stung her into telling the truth about the whole affair, right  then and there.  "Mrs. Green and I didn't get on well together," she confessed.
