Outline: Jimmy Rabbit is sitting on top of a pile of vegetables in a wheelbarrow, being pushed by Frisky Squirrel. Jimmy is teasing Frisky, telling him that he's not strong enough to push the wheelbarrow. This makes Frisky determined to get the wheelbarrow up the hill to Jimmy's house. He finally makes it and Jimmy hops off. Frisky is so tired, he falls asleep.

The next day, Jimmy asks Billy Woodchuck to push the wheelbarrow for him. Billy does, and Jimmy has a free ride home. This continues for a while, with Jimmy's friends taking turns pushing the wheelbarrow. But eventually, all of Jimmy's friends stop coming around, until the only one left is Fatty Coon.

Jimmy doesn't like Fatty, but he agrees to let him push the wheelbarrow. Fatty is strong and doesn't get tired easily. But after a while, he stops and says he's getting hungry. Jimmy gets worried, knowing that Fatty might try to eat him. He throws a handful of green peas to Fatty, who eats them greedily.

Jimmy keeps throwing vegetables to Fatty, until there are none left. The only thing left is a big turnip. Jimmy picks it up and throws it at Fatty, hitting him in the stomach. Fatty falls over and starts rolling down the hill. Jimmy is glad to be rid of him and runs home with the empty wheelbarrow.

Story so far:  Fatty Coon is finding it hard to catch food, and Jimmy Rabbit is worried that he will steal his new wheelbarrow. However, Jimmy has a happy thought and feeds Fatty some green peas. A man throws a turnip at Fatty Coon, who falls over and starts to roll because he is so fat. Frisky Squirrel struggles to push a wheelbarrow home with Jimmy Rabbit on top, and Jimmy tells him that it's because he's not used to it and he's not as strong as Jimmy. Frisky the fox is tired from carrying a wheelbarrow up a hill, but he perseveres and makes it to Jimmy Rabbit's house. The next day, he stays away from Farmer Green's garden. A boy named Jimmy throws vegetables to a greedy raccoon named Fatty Coon. Fatty Coon eats the vegetables greedily and keeps asking for more until there are none left. Jimmy's friends stop coming to play with him in the garden, so he agrees to let Fatty Coon push his wheelbarrow, even though he doesn't really like him. Jimmy Rabbit has a change of heart about Farmer Green's garden and decides to bring home two loads of vegetables each day instead of just one. Jimmy Rabbit is glad to be rid of Fatty Coon and runs home as fast as he can. Jimmy Rabbit is gathering vegetables with Fatty Coon. Fatty is strong and doesn't get tired easily, but finally lets go of the handles. Jimmy asks if he's tired.

Last chunk: the fun (Jimmy was always careful to speak of gathering vegetables  and wheeling them home as "fun").  When the barrow was full, Jimmy Rabbit again climbed on top of the load.  But he kept very close watch of Fatty. And he was ready, any moment, to  leap off the wheelbarrow in case Fatty should reach for his legs.  Fatty Coon was strong. He did not tire so easily as the others had. But  finally he let go the handles and straightened up.  "What's the matter?" asked Jimmy. "You're not tired, are
