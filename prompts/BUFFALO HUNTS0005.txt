Outline: Johnnie Green's father tells him that owning a cow is a big responsibility, and Johnnie soon learns that this means he has to do things like milk her, even if he'd rather be doing something else. The Muley Cow is always escaping to the back pasture, and Johnnie has to chase her down each time. He eventually turns this into a game, pretending to hunt her like a buffalo, but the Muley Cow is not amused. One day, she gets revenge by holding back her milk when Johnnie tries to milk her.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green used to call his old cow "Muley Cow." If he didn't see her, he knew she was in the back pasture again. The back pasture was overgrown and offered a fine hiding place for the cow. Sometimes it took Johnnie a good hour to find her. The passage describes how a boy named Johnnie Green came to own a Muley Cow, and how the cow soon learned that Johnnie would always come for her, no matter where she went. The Muley Cow enjoyed making Johnnie work for her, as she felt it was good for him. However, Johnnie did not seem to share this view, and generally tried to avoid work whenever possible. Johnnie Green finds that there are times when he would rather not have to milk his cow. Johnnie Green whistles to his dog, old Spot, to make him stop chasing a cow. He knows the cow is holding back her milk because he teased her. Johnnie learned that he could make a game out of anything his father wanted him to do. He enjoyed buffalo hunts in the back pasture with old dog Spot. The Muley Cow found it exciting too. The first time that Johnnie tried to lasso her with a length of his mother's clothesline she started for home on a lumbering gallop. And Johnnie chased her.

Last chunk: thing to do was to make play of  it. By pretending hard enough, Johnnie had discovered that he could  make a game of almost anything his father wanted him to do.  So it wasn't long before he was enjoying buffalo hunts in the back  pasture. With old dog Spot along it was a lively game and most exciting.  The Muley Cow found it exciting too. The first time that Johnnie tried  to lasso her with a length of his mother's clothesline she started for  home on a lumbering gallop.  And Johnnie chased her
