Outline: Ben is an orphan who lives with his dog, Sancho. He is taken in by Miss Celia, who treats him like her own son. She promises to never send him back to the orphanage, and he swears loyalty to her. Miss Celia plays the piano to comfort him after he learns of his father's death, and he falls asleep.

Story so far:  The passage describes a woman's reaction to reading two letters. Her face grows sad, and she looks at the happy face of a boy with pity. Ben is upset and Miss Celia tries to comfort him by playing music. Bab is happy to have found a friend in Rand, and is glad that Miss Celia is letting her teach him to ride. Miss Celia tells Ben that his father is not coming back, and Ben reacts with sorrow.

Last chunk: there was a quiver in her voice, the meaning of which  he felt before he understood.  Miss Celia put her arms about him, and answered very tenderly,--"Ben,  dear, if I were to tell you that he was never coming back, could you  bear it?"  "I guess I could,--but you don't mean it?  Oh, ma'am, he isn't dead?"  cried Ben, with a cry that made her heart ache, and Sancho leap up with  a bark.  "My poor little boy, I wish I could say no."  There was no need of any more words, no need of tears or kind
