Outline: Cuffy Bear and his sister Silkie are playing and pretending to make maple-sugar. Cuffy wishes for some real maple-sugar and gets angry with the make-believe sugar. He trots down the mountainside and finds a little house in a clearing with a man coming in and out. Cuffy smells the sweet smell of maple-sugar and goes to the door of the sugar-house. He sticks his head inside and starts gulping mouthfuls of the sugar. The man comes back and sees Cuffy with his paws in the pan of bubbling syrup.

Story so far:  Cuffy smells two things, one of which is very sweet and makes his nose want to go forward. The other smell made his legs want to run away. His nose won and he went to the sugar-house to find the source of the sweet smell. A man is chopping wood near a woodpile. Cuffy watches him and smells the man's scent, which he does not like. Cuffy drinks sap from a tree, imagining how sweet sugar must taste, and then spies a little house in a clearing. Cuffy Bear and his sister Silkie were playing and pretending to make maple sugar. Cuffy wished that there were maple trees near his house so that they could really make maple sugar. Cuffy and Silkie make little cakes of snow and pretend they are maple-sugar. When Cuffy is alone and angry, he hits the little cakes of snow and spoils them.

Last chunk: for some _real_ maple-sugar.  After all, the little cakes of snow that he and Silkie made and _called_  maple-sugar seemed very tasteless, no matter how much Cuffy pretended.  And later, when Silkie was taking her nap, and Cuffy had no one to play  with, he became so angry with the make-believe sugar that he struck the  little pats of snow as hard as he could and spoiled them. And then,  after one look toward the door of his father's house--to make sure that  his mother did not see him--Cuffy
