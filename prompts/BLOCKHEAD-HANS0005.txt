Outline: A princess announces that she will marry the man who can choose his words the best, and two of the squire's sons set out to win her hand. The brothers are both learned and think they are sure to win, but they are bested by their blockheaded younger brother, Hans. Hans gives the Princess a dead crow, an old wooden shoe, and some mud, which amuses her so much that she chooses him as her husband. The two brothers are furious, but Hans is crowned and lives happily ever after with his new wife.

Story so far: The passage tells the story of Blockhead-Hans and his two brothers, who are all vying for the hand of a princess. Blockhead-Hans is not as learned as his brothers, but he is clever and determined. When he sees them in their Sunday best clothes, he asks where they are going. They tell him they are going to court the princess. Blockhead-Hans wants to get married, but his father won't give him a horse, saying he is not like his brothers.

Last chunk: they told him all about it.  'Hurrah! I'll go to!' cried Blockhead-Hans; and the brothers laughed at  him and rode off.  'Dear father!' cried Blockhead-Hans, 'I must have a horse too. What a  desire for marriage has seized me! If she will have me, she WILL have  me, and if she won't have me, I will have her.'  'Stop that nonsense!' said the old man. 'I will not give you a horse.  YOU can't speak; YOU don't know how to choose your words. Your brothers!  Ah! they are very different lads!'  'Well,'
