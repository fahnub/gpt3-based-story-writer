Outline: Miss Kitty Cat is perched on top of Rusty Wren's tin house, enjoying herself and teasing the birds, when she suddenly hears a strange catcall. She can't see where it's coming from, but the birds all start warning her about the mysterious stranger. Miss Kitty Cat is determined to find the source of the noise and teach them a lesson, but no matter where she looks, she can't find anyone.

The catcalls continue, moving from one place to another, and Miss Kitty Cat starts to wonder if there's simply a disembodied voice jeering at her. Finally, she comes face to face with the culprit: Mr. Catbird, who has been imitating a cat to tease her. The other birds all join in, making so much noise that Miss Kitty Cat retreats to the haymow to get away from them.

Story so far:  The birds are excited because a strange, mocking cat has arrived, and Miss Kitty Cat is angry. She challenges the cat to a fight. Miss Kitty Cat is startled to hear another cat meow, but can't see where it's coming from. Miss Kitty and Mrs. Wren are discussing a 'noisy stranger' that is jeering at Miss Kitty. Mrs. Wren challenges Miss Kitty to go find the stranger and prove that she is not a fraud. The stranger mocking call is heard again and Mrs. Wren points it out. The passage describes how a cat named Miss Kitty is bothered by the birds around her, especially Mr. Catbird and Mrs. Wren. She eventually hides in the haymow to get away from the noise.

Last chunk: enough when she saw him. She knew that he had succeeded in  fooling her with his mocking cries.  The birds--with Mr. Catbird among them, and Mrs. Wren, too--all gathered  round Miss Kitty and made such a clamor that she crept away and hid in  the haymow. She never could endure much noise, unless she made most of  it herself--by the light Of the moon.
