Outline: Rusty Wren and Daddy Longlegs are talking and Daddy Longlegs boastfully tells Rusty about how he rode in Farmer Green's wagon. Rusty is unimpressed and tells Daddy Longlegs that riding in a wagon is nothing and that it's not dangerous. This makes Daddy Longlegs angry and he tells Rusty that he is jealous and that he always makes it a rule not to argue with jealous people. Rusty is sorry and tries to change the subject by asking Daddy Longlegs about his cousin's party. Daddy Longlegs tells Rusty that he was sorry he missed it but he couldn't come because of the high wind. Rusty tells Daddy Longlegs that there was no party and that the party was actually a year earlier. This makes Daddy Longlegs laugh and Rusty is annoyed. Rusty tells Daddy Longlegs that there is no wind now so he can go anywhere he wants to go. Daddy Longlegs takes the hint and leaves.
