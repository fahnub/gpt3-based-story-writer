Outline: Cuffy Bear is planning to steal a pig from Farmer Green's pig pen. He knows he must be careful not to meet Farmer Green, his son Johnnie, or his hired man. Cuffy sees them all ploughing in a field and goes to the pig pen. He seizes a little white pig in his mouth and starts to run away. The pig makes a loud noise and Cuffy drops it and runs away. Cuffy is scared and decides he never wants to see or hear a pig again.

Story so far:  Cuffy is relieved to see that Johnnie and the hired man are ploughing in a field, and so he walks boldly into the pig-pen. Cuffy has a pig in his mouth and is running away with it, but the pig is squealing very loudly, so Cuffy is having second thoughts. Cuffy Bear is sad because he realizes that it will be a long time before any of the animals have a birthday and his father will be able to bring home another little pig for a feast. Cuffy Bear is curious about when his birthday is, and his mother tells him it is on the day the wild geese begin to fly south. Cuffy then asks about when Silkie's birthday is, and his mother tells him it is on the day of the first snow. The Bear family doesn't celebrate birthdays often because the day of the great forest fire is the only day their father can have a birthday. It's a lot like being born on February 29th.

Last chunk: gone.  "And Father's?" he inquired once more.  Mrs. Bear shook her head.  "Your father hasn't many birthdays," she said. "He was born on the day  of the great forest fire. It may be a long time before he has another  birthday. I hope so, anyhow," she added, "for a great forest fire is a  dreadful thing."  Now you see, having a birthday like that is a good deal like being born  on the twenty-ninth of February, when you have a birthday only once in  four years. Yes--it's a good deal like that,
