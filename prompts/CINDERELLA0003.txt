Story so far: Cinderella is a young girl who is treated poorly by her stepmother and stepsisters. They tell her about the beautiful princess they met at the ball, but Cinderella shows no interest. A prince falls in love with a woman who loses a glass slipper at a ball, and he searches for her throughout the kingdom. He eventually finds her and marries her. The godmother of a young princess tells her that she must leave the ball before midnight, or else she will turn back into a pumpkin. The princess is overjoyed at the prospect of attending the ball and agrees to leave on time. Cinderella's godmother, who is a fairy, asks her what is wrong and Cinderella tells her that she wishes she could go to the ball. The godmother tells her that she will see to it that she goes. Cinderella goes to the ball, and her two sisters come home and are surprised at how late she is. Cinderella's step-sisters were invited to a ball thrown by the King's son and they were very excited. Cinderella had to help them prepare and she was not happy about it. Cinderella's mother dies when she is young, leaving her in the care of her father and older step-sisters. The step-sisters are unkind to her and make her work as a servant. They mockingly call her "Cinderella" because she has to sift through the ashes. A voice called to Cinderella as she sat crying over her unkind sisters, telling her to go to the ball.
