Story so far: A group of friends are stranded on a mountain. Button Bright asks to see how the Ork's tail works, and the Ork explains that it is his tail and he reserves the right to whirl it himself. Button-Bright then proposes they go out and fly somewhere so he can see how the tail works. The Ork declines, saying he only flies when he is going somewhere. Cap'n Bill releases all the birds except for three, which Trot decides are the most beautiful she has ever seen. The Wizard of Oz presents the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion with gray clothes, which they use to make swings to ride on the birds. The Ork is their leader. Three of the bird-men agree to be transformed by the one-legged man, who assures them that the transformation will be permanent. The bird-men seem to want to be bigger for some reason. The old sailor ties all the birds together and fastens them to a stone so they can't escape. The Bumpy Man watches with curiosity and asks what will happen to the birds when they find they can't fly. The sailor replies that they may be a little worried but they won't be hurt if they take it easy. Cap'n Bill gave the Ork three berries, which caused the Ork to grow larger. Cap'n Bill captures several birds by tying cords around their legs while they eat. Toto begins to dig a hole, and Dorothy scolds him. Dorothy talks to a boy who is digging and discovers that he doesn't know where he came from or where he is going. She is surprised that he doesn't know anything and wonders what he will do next.

Last chunk: Dorothy watched the boy dig.  "Where do you live?" she asked.  "Don't know," was the reply.  "How did you come here?"  "Don't know," he said again.  "Don't you know where you came from?"  "No," said he.  "Why, he must be lost," she said to the shaggy man.  She turned to the  boy once more.  "What are you going to do?" she inquired.  "Dig," said he.  "But you can't dig forever; and what are you going to do then?" she  persisted.  "Don't know," said the boy.  "But you MUST know SOMETHING,"
