Outline: Tired Tim Beaver asks Mr. Frog how he can be as fashionable as him. Mr. Frog says he'll be glad to oblige a friend, but he couldn't--and wouldn't--be hurried. Tim returns to the village in the pond in a terrible state of mind. Since he told everyone  else what he had learned about Ferdinand Frog and his clothes, it was  only a short time before the whole Beaver family was so stirred up that  they couldn't do a stroke of work. Ferdinand Frog was in everybody's  mouth, so to speak. And at last old Grandaddy Beaver hit upon a plan.

"Why don't you get somebody to make you a suit exactly like Mr. Frog's?"  he asked Tired Tim.

So Tired Tim took Grandaddy's advice. That very night he disappeared, to  swagger back in a few days in a costume that made him appear almost  like Mr. Frog's twin brother--if one didn't look at his face. And there  were some among the villagers who even declared that Tired Tim's mouth  seemed wider than it had been, and more like Mr. Frog's.

When they asked Tired Tim if his tailor hadn't stretched his mouth for  him he replied no, that he had been smiling a good deal for a day or  two, and perhaps that was what made his mouth look different.

Well, the whole Beaver village was delighted with Tired Tim's new suit.

"Wait till Mr. Frog sees you!" people cried. "He'll be _so_ surprised!"

And somebody swam away in great haste to find Mr. Frog and ask him to  come to the lower end of the pond, where all the houses were. But when  Ferdinand Frog arrived, everybody was disappointed, and especially  Tired Tim, who had felt very proud in his gorgeous new clothes. For he  saw at once that Mr. Frog was arrayed from head to foot in an entirely  new outfit. He looked almost like a rainbow, so brilliant were the  colors of his costume.

At the same time Tired Tim put on as brave a front as he could. And  drawing near to Mr. Frog, he said:

"What do you think of my new suit?"

Ferdinand Frog looked at him as if he hadn't noticed him before.

Story so far:  Mr. Frog and Tired Tim meet at the lower end of the pond. Mr. Frog is wearing a new, brightly-colored outfit, and Tired Tim is feeling proud in his own new clothes. Tired Tim Beaver asks Mr. Frog how a person might catch up with him in the matter of clothes. Mr. Frog says that he cannot be hurried. The beaver village is delighted with Tired Tim's new suit, and somebody is sent to find Mr. Frog to show him. In the passage, Tired Tim Beaver shows his new suit to Ferdinand Frog, who criticizes it. Tim is upset by the criticism and sinks to the bottom of the pond to rest. His family members also don't seem to like the new suit. The passage describes how the children in the story went home with a great longing to be like the elegant stranger, Ferdinand Frog. Tired Tim gets a suit to make him look like Ferdinand Frog in order to take advantage of the frog's popularity. Tired Tim Beaver returns to the village in the pond in a terrible state of mind after being teased by Mr. Frog. He tells everyone what he has learned about Ferdinand Frog and his clothes, and the whole Beaver family is soon stirred up.

Last chunk: teased and begged him to tell his  secret, Mr. Frog only smiled the more cheerfully and said nothing.  It was maddening--for Tired Tim--though Mr. Frog seemed to be enjoying  himself hugely. And the result was that Tired Tim Beaver returned to the  village in the pond in a terrible state of mind. Since he told everyone  else what he had learned about Ferdinand Frog and his clothes, it was  only a short time before the whole Beaver family was so stirred up that  they couldn't do a stroke of work.
