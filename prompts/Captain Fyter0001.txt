Outline: Captain Fyter was a soldier who fell in love with a beautiful Munchkin girl named Nimmie Amee. The Wicked Witch who didn't want them to be together enchanted his sword and he was gradually cut to pieces. He went to the tinsmith, Ku-Klip, who made him into a Tin Soldier. Nimmie Amee's tin sweetheart, Nick Chopper (the Tin Woodman), had disappeared and she took an interest in the Tin Soldier. They were going to elope on the day of their wedding, but the Wicked Witch came back and he had to stand in the forest rusting. The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Woot the Wanderer came across him and he told his story. They all decided that the Tin Soldier and the Tin Woodman should both go to Nimmie Amee's house and she could choose between them.

"But--dear me!" cried the Tin Woodman, sadly perplexed; "how came you to be made of tin?"  "That," answered the Soldier, "is a sad, sad story I was in love with a beautiful Munchkin girl, who
