Outline: In May, Brer Rabbit is feeling fine and sets off down the road without knowing where he's going. He meets Brer Tarrypin, who asks him where he's headed. Brer Rabbit tells him he's going to have some fun and show everyone a new trick.

Brer Rabbit then heads to Miss Motts and Miss Meadows' houses to tell them about the mill pond fishin' party he's throwing. Everyone agrees to come and they all meet at the pond.

Brer Rabbit jumps in, pretending to be looking for fish, but instead he finds the moon! He calls everyone over to take a look. They all agree that they need to get the moon out of the pond or else it will be goodbye to the light at night.

They all grab onto the seine and start to haul it in, but they have trouble because they're all either too tall or too short. Brer Rabbit just laughs and enjoys the show.

In the end, they all get wet and the moon is safe.

Story so far:  Brer Rabbit and Miss Molly Har' agree to meet at a certain time and place. When the time comes, there is a big crowd of people, and Brer Rabbit is there, waiting for the fun to begin. He shakes his shank and goes to the bank, and makes like he is going to jump in. But what he sees makes him drop his jaw and grin. Brer Rabbit is planning to fish, and he tells all the animals about it. They all say they'll be there to help, and he leaves them wishing they could come. Brer Coon and Brer Fox discuss how to get the moon out of the pond after it falls in. They decide to drag it out with a seine, but when it comes to actually doing the work, they start to argue.

An' uv dat dey ain't no doubt;  "We got ter have light when we play at night,   Fer ter see how ter git about;   We'll drag wid de seine--ef we don't drag in vain,   We'll have good reason ter shout!"
