Outline: Fairy Tenderheart is weeping because she can't stand the fighting she sees going on in the world. Her sisters try to comfort her, but she is inconsolable. She asks an older fairy why men fight, and is told that they just do, and that there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Fairy Tenderheart is determined to find a way to help, and sets off on a journey to find the Oldest Fairy of All, who might be able to help her.

She finally finds her in a Magic Garden, and the Oldest Fairy tells her that the only way to stop war is with the Plant of Knowledge, which has the power to turn people against war. They set off to plant the seeds of the Plant of Knowledge in children's gardens all over the world, in the hope that they will grow up to be a new generation who will scorn war.

Story so far: The Oldest Fairy and her sister take their Plant of Knowledge to the children's gardens to spread the message of peace. Fairy Tenderheart is hopeful that the children who see the plant will never tread it in the mud. She plans to take seeds to all the children's gardens in the world. However, she is sad that her work will not be complete for a long time. The Plant of Knowledge is the only thing that can end war, and the Oldest Fairy of All has planted it in many places. Fairy Tenderheart is upset because of the fighting and bloodshed she sees in the world. However, she is most pleased with a plant that grew no taller than the others, had no great show of color, yet radiated a light from within. The speaker is trying to dissuade someone from going to a Magic Garden, saying that the person who dwells there will never come back to the speaker's Fairyland. In the passage, a fairy named Fairy Tenderheart enters a garden and is greeted by the Oldest Fairy of All. The Oldest Fairy tells her that those who enter the garden can never return to Fairyland, and Fairy Tenderheart says that she has come to learn how she can help the suffering earth.

Last chunk: flowers, and her eyes were filled with peace. She looked at Fairy Tenderheart standing at the gate. "Who enters here can never return to Fairyland," she said, and her voice was sweeter than the songs of birds.  Fairy Tenderheart pushed open the gate and stepped within the Garden. "Who enters here finds joy," said the Oldest Fairy of All, and a crown of happiness sat on her hair.  "You come to work?" she asked.  "I come to learn what I may do to help the suffering earth," said Fairy Tenderheart.
