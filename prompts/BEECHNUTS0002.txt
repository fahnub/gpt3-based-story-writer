Outline: Down the hill from Farmer Green's house, a great beech tree stands beside the road. In the fall, when the nuts are ripe, Johnnie Green, Frisky Squirrel, and Jasper Jay all visit the tree to eat the beechnuts. They all think of the tree as theirs, and nobody else's.

One day in the fall, Grunty Pig wanders down the road and smells the beechnuts. He begins to search for them among the fallen leaves and finds a cluster of them inside a bur that the frost has split open. He eats the sweet nuts, shells and all.

Last chunk: wandered down the road, stopped right between the wheel  tracks, and sniffed. It was Grunty Pig. "I smell beechnuts!" he cried  with a joyful squeal. And crashing into the light underbrush along the  roadside, he began to search among the fallen leaves with his long nose.  Soon Grunty came upon a cluster of the three-sided nuts, clinging inside  a bur that the frost had split open. He ate the sweet nuts, shells and  all.
