Outline: In the story, "A New Name for Daddy", the protagonist, Daddy Longlegs, is a spider who has lost one of his legs. His neighbor, little Mr. Chippy, comes up with the idea that since Daddy Longlegs is so changed, they should call him by a different name. Mr. Chippy suggests the name "Grandfather Graybeard", but Buster Bumblebee doesn't think much of that name because Daddy Longlegs has no beard.
