Outline: The shaggy man, Button-Bright, Dorothy, and Toto are captured by the Scoodlers, who intend to make them into soup. The Scoodlers are led by a Queen who is half red and half yellow. The captives are put in a store-room with a guard, but the shaggy man uses the Love Magnet to make the guard let them go. They make a run for it, but the Scoodlers give chase and begin throwing their heads at them. The shaggy man catches all the heads and throws them into a black gulf. With the Scoodlers' heads gone, their bodies are helpless and the captives escape.

Story so far:  The Queen asks if the children think she's beautiful, and they all say no. The Scoodler hurls the head of the shaggy man's head at the Rainbow's Daughter, but the shaggy man catches it and puts it in a sack. The body of the guard runs around aimlessly, and the shaggy man easily dodges it and opens the door to the big cave.

Last chunk: whirling  away from him quickly to rejoin her friends.  The angry Scoodler at once picked off his head and hurled it at the  Rainbow's Daughter; but the shaggy man was expecting that, and caught  the head very neatly, putting it in the sack, which he tied at the  mouth.  The body of the guard, not having the eyes of its head to guide  it, ran here and there in an aimless manner, and the shaggy man easily  dodged it and opened the door.  Fortunately, there was no one in the  big cave at that
