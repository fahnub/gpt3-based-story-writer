Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes a competition, a boy's abuse of animals, and a doctor's house visit. Ben is grateful for Thorny's friendship but feels sad because it comes so soon after another loss. The boys in the passage are disappointed to hear that their cousin was unable to find their lost dog. The owner of the black poodle they find says he bought the dog from a stranger and is also upset at the loss of the animal. The Muley Cow explains to Twinkleheels that a horse's record is the fastest time he ever makes in a race. Ebenezer then tells Twinkleheels that they will have another race the next time they're in the pasture together. Freddie Firefly knows that Benjamin Bat is scared, but he does not know why. Benjamin is afraid of being singed by Freddie. Freddie finds this amusing. Horace has killed the dog, but Thorny and Ben think he probably just ran away and will come back. A man plays an organ for a group of children, who are entertained by the music and the monkey. Benjy climbs up to the top of a tree and meets the Man in the Moon, who invites him into Beastland. Benjy finds the place to be both funny and beautiful, and the beasts are very polite.

Last chunk: Can  you climb?"  "I guess I can," said Benjy, and he climbed up first on one branch, then  up higher on to another, till he stood on the very top, and all he could  see about him was a shining white light.  "Walk right in," said the Man in the Moon. "Put out your feet,--don't be  afraid!" So Benjy stepped into the moon and found himself in Beastland.  Oh! it was such a funny place, and yet it was very beautiful. There were  many more beasts there than in a menagerie, and they were so polite to
