Outline: The story is about a frog who is a tailor and the beaver family who are his customers. The frog is trying to collect payment from the beavers for their new clothes, but the beavers refuse to pay, saying that it's not fashionable to do so. The frog then tricks the beavers into paying him by pretending that he will make their clothes for free if they promise to wear them. The beavers agree and the frog gets his payment. In the end, the frog laughs at the beavers for their new clothes and for falling for his trick.

Story so far:  In this fable, Mr. Frog tries to convince the Beaver family that they need to pay him for their new suits, even though it is not fashionable to do so. The Beavers object, but Mr. Frog insists. In the end, the Beavers are forced to pay and learn their lesson. Mr. Frog asks Stingy Steve to pay him back sixty tape-measures, which is what he borrowed.

Frog objects, but Steve insists that this will be the norm in five years. Frog is incredulous, but soon realizes that Steve's customers are all paying in the same way. Mr. Frog is offered payment for his services, but he declines, instead asking that the people promise to wear the new clothes he will make for them. They agree, and he leaps into the air in celebration. A frog is asking a group of animals to pay him for a delivery, and warning them not to crowd. When nobody moves, he jumps in front of a beaver.

Last chunk: Frog continued to smile at them. He was such an  agreeable chap!  "I know it's not fashionable now," he admitted, "but it will be five  years from now. And since it's my way to collect on delivery, I'll thank  you to step up one at a time and pay me. . . . And please don't crowd!"  he added.  There was really no need of that last warning, because nobody made a  move.  Mr. Frog, however, was not dismayed. He leaped suddenly into the air and  alighted directly in front of a Beaver known among his
