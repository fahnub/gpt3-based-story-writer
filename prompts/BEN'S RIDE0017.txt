Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

This horrified Bab and Betty.

"But the black dog had no tail," began Thorny, longing to be convinced,  but still doubtful.  Ben shivered as if the mere thought hurt him, as he said, in a grim  tone,--  "They might have cut Sanch's off."  "Oh, no! no! they mustn't,--they wouldn't! How Could any one be so  wicked?" cried Bab and Betty, horrified at the suggestion.  "You don't know what such fellows would do to make all safe, so
