Outline: Nimble's mother is taking him to Farmer Green's carrot patch to have his first taste of carrots. However, she is surprised and dismayed to find that dozens of other forest folk are also coming along. She tries to send them all away, but Nimble begs her to let them stay.

She reluctantly agrees, but is worried about old dog Spot. Sure enough, Spot starts barking and chasing them all around the farm. They all finally escape and Nimble's mother is very angry with him.

However, the other animals are all very excited about the adventure and say they'll come back anytime Nimble's mother wants. She tells them it won't be anytime soon, and they all go their separate ways.

Story so far:  The mother of Nimble the deer tells him that he can go to the garden any night, and Jimmy Rabbit whispers to Nimble that he should let Jimmy know when he goes so that Jimmy can come too. Nimble's mother does not want company when taking him to the carrot patch for the first time, but does not want to be impolite by telling them to go away. Nimble's mother takes him to Farmer Green's carrot patch, but is surprised to find that many other forest folk are already there. Nimble's mother explains to Jimmy Rabbit and the other animals that she won't be going to the carrot patch that night. When asked when she'll be going, she says she doesn't know when she'll be able to go. The woman is angry because her son invited people to the farm without her permission. Nimble suspects that he has made a mistake, and later realizes that he was right.

Last chunk: know when the time comes!"  But Nimble said never a word. Somehow he suspected that he had made a  great mistake.  He _knew_ he had, a little later.
