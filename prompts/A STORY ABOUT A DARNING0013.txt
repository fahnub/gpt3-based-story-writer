Outline: The story is about a darning-needle who believes she is an embroidery-needle and is very proud. She is being used by the fingers to sew a shoe upper leather and is not happy with the common work. She breaks and is then stuck in the front of the cook's dress with sealing-wax. She is now a breast-pin and is very proud of herself. She talks to a bit of bottle-glass and they both think they are very costly. The bit of bottle-glass is washed away and the darning-needle is left. Two boys find her and stick her in an egg-shell. A wagon-wheel goes over her but she does not break.

Story so far:  The Darning-needle is very slim, and thinks she is even finer than before. The boys stick her into an egg-shell, and she says she is glad to be seen to advantage. She is not sea-sick, and thinks it is good to be steeled against it. The darning needle is proud and falls into the sink. It gets lost and ends up in the gutter, saying it is too fine for this world. The Darning-needle is very proud of herself after being promoted to a breast-pin. She laughs to herself and then asks the Pin if she is made of gold. Two children are playing in the gutter when one of them finds a darning needle and pricks himself. The darning needle protests that it is actually a young lady, but no one hears her. The sealing wax has gone and she has become black, but black is still a beautiful color. The darning needle breaks while sewing the cook's shoe, and is then good for nothing. The darning needle is happy that it has an advantage over humans, but then it is squashed by a wagon wheel and realizes that it will now die.

Last chunk: advantage over man! Now my qualms are over. The finer one is  the more one can beat.'  'Crack!' said the egg-shell as a wagon-wheel went over it.  'Oh! how it presses!' said the Darning-needle. 'I shall indeed be  sea-sick now. I am breaking!' But she did not break, although the  wagon-wheel went over her; she lay there at full length, and there she  may lie.
