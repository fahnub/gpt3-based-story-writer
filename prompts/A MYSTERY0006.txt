Outline: Snowball, a sheep, is knocked down by a black ram and decides he must be sheared. He goes to the pasture to find his old companions, but they are so changed by shearing that he can't tell who is who. He grins at them, and the big old dame scolds him, telling him he will be sheared too. Farmer Green comes in and Johnnie Green says he wants to shear Snowball himself.

Johnnie Green doesn't want his father to shear Snowball, because he wants to do it himself. In the morning, Snowball found that he had been mistaken and Johnnie Green had caught him.
