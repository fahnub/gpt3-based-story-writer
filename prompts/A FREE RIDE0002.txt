Outline: Grumpy Weasel is hiding in a jug to escape Henry Hawk, when he is discovered by Farmer Brown. Old dog Spot smells Grumpy and starts to whine and yelp, but Farmer Brown cannot understand him. Farmer Brown loads the jug onto his wagon and sets off for home, with Grumpy still inside.

Grumpy Weasel is angry at being kidnapped, and even more so when he is left high up on a shelf in the barn. He escapes and gloats over old dog Spot, who was unable to catch him.

Story so far:  Farmer Green couldn't understand a word the weasel said, so he left him behind. However, his dog Spot wouldn't stop hovering around the weasel, so Farmer Green went back to see what was going on. Farmer Green picks up a jug and sets it in the back of his wagon, with Spot following. All the way down the road, Spot acts like a simpleton, much to Grumpy Weasel's anger. A weasel is hiding from a dog and farmer near some barrels. The weasel doesn't care if the dog makes noise, but when the dog starts running around and almost trips the farmer, the weasel gets worried.

Last chunk: horse Ebenezer. And of course  Grumpy Weasel didn't care to show himself just then, especially with  old dog Spot nosing around. He had already heard Spot give several sharp  yelps.  "That old dog knows I'm here somewhere but he can't tell exactly where,"  Grumpy said to himself. "He can yelp his head off, for all I care."  And then Spot began to whine, and run in and out among the barrels,  until he all but tripped Farmer Green, who was loading the barrels into  the wagon.  "Let him whine!"
