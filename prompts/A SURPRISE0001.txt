Outline: Cuffy Bear, his sister Silkie, and their father Mr. Bear live in the mountains. One day, when they're finished playing with sand pies, they notice Mr. Bear coming up the mountain with something in his mouth. They run to meet him and ask what it is. He tells them it's a surprise. 

It turns out to be a small white pig. They've never eaten pig before, but they all agree it's delicious. They have a feast and Mr. Bear is very pleased with himself. Cuffy and Silkie both wish that every day could be their birthday.

Story so far:  Mr. Bear brings his wife a pig for her birthday and they have a feast. Cuffy enjoyed his birthday surprise so much that he wishes every day could be his birthday. Cuffy the bear comes across a porcupine and is surprised to find that it is not harmful. He asks Mr. Bear what it is, and Mr. Bear tells him that he will see. Silkie the rabbit asks if it is a new kind of rabbit, and Cuffy laughs, saying that of course it is not. Cuffy and Silkie are excited to see the surprise that Mr. Bear has for them. When they see the animal, they realize that it is a rabbit. Mr. Bear's mouth was stretched wide in a smile, and his children Cuffy and Silkie knew that he was feeling pleasant. Silkie asked what it was, and Cuffy was already smelling the small white animal that his father had. Mr. Bear is climbing up a mountain with something in his hands. His children, Cuffy Bear and Silkie, see him and run to him to see what he has.

Last chunk: A SURPRISE (Fable:- Ages 3 to 5)    One day Cuffy Bear and his little sister Silkie had been making sand  pies. And now, having grown tired of that, they were squatting down on  the ground and had covered their legs with the clean white sand. Perhaps  they would have heaped the sand all over themselves, if Silkie had not  spied her father as he came climbing up the mountain. When they noticed  that he was carrying something they both sprang up and ran to see what  Mr. Bear was bringing home.
