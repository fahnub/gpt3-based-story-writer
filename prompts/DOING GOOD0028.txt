Story so far: A woman and her children visit a priest, who tells them about a treasure hidden by their ancestors. The children are excited to find the treasure, but are disappointed when they find it is just a carpet. The woman is speaking in a foreign language and ends with a question. Robert, who is holding the Phoenix, asks it to translate the woman's words. Cyril lays on his back at the foot of the stairs, with his head on the top step and his feet among his young relations, and oils the bolt of his father's bicycle. When the bolt still won't move, he ties it with string. The children in the passage found a small spring and decided to wash their hands and faces in it. Although their pocket-handkerchiefs were too small, they managed to clean themselves up. The passage discusses how the children feel about being selfish and mean. Cyril believes that they are not really being selfish, while Anthea feels that they are. Robert believes that it is worse to know that you are being selfish and not feel bad about it. The woman in the passage is doubtful at first, but she is convinced by the others that what they are telling her is true. The children in the passage are trying to figure out who the owners of a treasure are, and the Phoenix suggests they ask around the area.

Last chunk: and good.  'Tell us,' she said to the Phoenix, 'what is the good and kind actionthe carpet brought us here to do?'  'I think it would be kind to find the owners of the treasure and tellthem about it,' said Cyril.  'And give it them ALL?' said Jane.  'Yes. But whose is it?'  'I should go to the first house and ask the name of the owner of thecastle,' said the golden bird, and really the idea seemed a good one.  They dusted each other as well as they could and went down the road. Alittle way on
