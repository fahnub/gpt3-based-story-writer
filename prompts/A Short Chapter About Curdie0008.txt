Outline: Curdie is a miner who spends his nights in the mine with his father and Mrs. Peterson. Every night, he works on earning a new red petticoat for Mrs. Peterson. When he is left alone in the mine, he explores the goblin territory. He finally discovers that the goblins are working on a new project that will cause an inundation. Curdie tries to warn his mother and the others, but they don't believe him. He then takes matters into his own hands and sets out to stop the goblins himself.

The passage describes someone observing a group of sappers and miners at work, and trying to determine what they are doing. The observer is unable to figure it out, and has to retreat each time they get too close. This passage describes how a woman created a heaven-like environment in her home, which her husband and son appreciated.

She would simply say that she followed the thread, just as he did in the mine. Curdie believed that there was more to her knowledge than she was letting on.

Last chunk: short one, he  always found his mother had got it right again.  There it was, wound in  a most respectable ball, ready for use the moment he should want it!  'I can't think how you do it, mother,' he would say.  'I follow the thread,' she would answer--'just as you do in the mine.'  She never had more to say about it; but the less clever she was with  her words, the more clever she was with her hands; and the less his  mother said, the more Curdie believed she had to say.
