Outline: In this poem, a child observer sees the Knapperines, a group of small children, going down a hill in front of Mrs. Knapp's house. The children are all bundled up in winter clothing, including purple mittens, mufflers, and Knitted jersey caps. On the way back up the hill, the child sees Mrs. Knapp slapping each of the children, leading the child to believe that she is punishing them for gathering stickers in their caps.

Story so far:  This passage describes a scene in which a group of children are being scolded by an adult. The children are wearing winter clothes, including purple mittens, mufflers, and knitted caps. The adult is slapping each child, and the narrator wonders if it is because the children have gathered stickers in their caps.

Last chunk: AS I WAS GOING DOWN THE HILL (Poetry:- Ages 0 to 3)      As I was going down the hill    In front of Missus Knapp's    I saw the little Knapperines    All in their winter wraps--    Purple mitts and mufflers    And knitted jersey caps.    As I was coming back again    In front of Missus Knapp's    I saw that awful lady    Give about a dozen slaps    To every little Knapperine--    I thought it was, perhaps,    Because they gathered stickers    In their knitted jersey caps.
