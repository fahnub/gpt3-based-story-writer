Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: A competition is underway to win a silver arrow. Ben and Bab are two of the best marksmen, but when the old lady catches Ben's jacket and begins questioning him, it seems that he may not be the winner after all. Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard.

Last chunk: fortune as a matter of course.  There was Mr. Frog! He was a famous jumper; but he couldn't fly. And  there was Mr. Nighthawk! He was a skillful flier; but he couldn't jump.  Such thoughts, however, never entered Kiddie Katydid's head. He went  cheerfully about his business--which was _eating_, principally--and  jumped or flew as the mood seized him. Indeed, if it hadn't been for  that queer fellow, Benjamin Bat, probably Kiddie never would have  realized just what he could--or couldn't--do.
