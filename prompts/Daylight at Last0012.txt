Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

Story so far: The explorers find themselves at the bottom of a deep well with an Ork. The Ork is cheerful, but the humans are dismayed. They all wonder how they will get out. The Ork offers to carry the humans up the well, but they are afraid of falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork escapes the well and is relieved to be in the sunlight again. The Ork tells the humans that he will take them with him when he leaves the cave, and the humans express concern about falling. The Ork reassures them that he will be able to carry them both. The Ork tells Trot and Cap'n Bill that it can fly out of the shaft using its mechanical propeller tail, and proceeds to do so. The Ork and Cap'n Bill have been walking through a tunnel for some time and Trot has been sleeping. Cap'n Bill wakes Trot up and they start walking again, hoping to find an exit. The passage describes a hill with a forest behind it. Cap'n Bill and Trot discuss whether the hill is an island, and Trot says that even if it is, it's better than the underground tunnels and caverns they were in before. The Ork agrees, and they all decide to be thankful for their escape.

Last chunk: at the left of  them. Behind the hill was a forest that shut out the view.  "I hope it ain't an island, Trot," said Cap'n Bill gravely.  "If it is, I s'pose we're prisoners," she replied.  "Ezzackly so, Trot."  "But, 'even so, it's better than those terr'ble underground tunnels and  caverns," declared the girl.  "You are right, little one," agreed the Ork. "Anything above ground is  better than the best that lies under ground. So let's not quarrel with  our fate but be thankful we've escaped."
