Outline: Rusty Wren brings home a ladybug to his wife, Mrs. Wren, who is pleased with the insect. However, Rusty soon realizes that the beetle tastes terrible and drops it on the ground. Mrs. Wren is upset with Rusty for bringing home the beetle and scolds him. Meanwhile, the beetle is nowhere to be found. Mrs. Wren talks to her friends about the incident later and they all agree that Rusty must have made a mistake.

Story so far:  Rusty Wren brings Mrs. Ladybug to Mrs. Wren, who is pleased with the gift. Rusty is glad that he was able to find such a nice present for Mrs. Wren and goes off to try to find another one just like it. Rusty finds a beetle and wants to feed it to the children, but Mrs. Wren won't let him because it's not safe. Mrs. Ladybug tells her friends about her adventure of being mistaken as food by Rusty the bird. The bird drops the beetle it was eating after tasting it, worried the children it was feeding wouldn't like it either, and sure enough, when the Mrs. Wren tried to eat it, there was trouble.

"I don't believe the children will notice anything wrong," he muttered.  "So far, they've never refused anything that was offered them. But if  Mrs. Wren tried to eat that beetle herself, I fear there'll be trouble."  And there was. Rusty knew it a few
