Outline: Johnnie Green is excited to learn that he may be able to get a lamb for a pet. He runs to the barnyard to try to catch a black lamb, but the lamb is too quick for him. Johnnie's father helps him catch the lamb, but Johnnie soon discovers that the lamb is too wild to be a pet. The lamb runs away and Johnnie is disappointed.

The next day, Johnnie's father comes home with a white lamb. Johnnie is excited to have a pet lamb of his own and names him Snowball. Snowball is a very active lamb and Johnnie has to be careful that he doesn't switch his tail off.

Story so far:  Johnnie is disappointed because the lamb he was playing with ran away. Farmer Green tries to cheer him up by telling him that the lamb is too wild to be a pet and that he will try to do something to make Johnnie happy. Johnnie's father gives him a lamb to take care of. Johnnie has to feed it milk from a bottle, and names it Snowball. He laughs at its tail, which is fluffy and white. Johnnie's dad tells him not to be glum, so he turns around and goes back to the woodshed. The next day, Johnnie sees a white lamb in the buggy. Johnnie Green's lamb ran away and ended up at his uncle's house. When Johnnie saw the lamb again, he was very happy. Johnnie's lamb was too spry for him to catch, so his father helped. Johnnie wanted to name his new pet, but before he could, the lamb escaped. Snowball is a lamb who is too young to know how to wag his tail properly, according to old dog Spot.

Last chunk: Snowball drank the milk he jerked his stubby tail up and down at  a great rate.  Old dog Spot, who was stretched upon the woodshed threshold, gazed at  Snowball with a lofty air.  "That lamb has a queer notion of the way a tail ought to be wagged," he  said deep down in his throat. "He ought to wag it from side to side. But  I suppose he's too young to know better."
