Outline: A princess announces that she will marry the man who can choose his words the best, and two of the squire's sons set out to win her hand. The brothers are both learned and think they are sure to win, but they are bested by their blockheaded younger brother, Hans. Hans gives the Princess a dead crow, an old wooden shoe, and some mud, which amuses her so much that she chooses him as her husband. The two brothers are furious, but Hans is crowned and lives happily ever after with his new wife.

Story so far:  The passage tells the story of how Blockhead-Hans filled his pockets with mud, while the brothers rode on so fast that they arrived at the town gate well before him. The suitors were then ranged in rows according to their arrival. The Princess is teasing Blockhead-Hans, saying that everything they say is being recorded and will be published in the paper tomorrow. The reporters giggle and each drops a blot of ink on the floor. A princess and a man named Blockhead-Hans are discussing what to cook a crow in. Blockhead-Hans suggests using an old wooden shoe, and the princess agrees. They then discuss getting soup, and Blockhead-Hans says he has some in his pocket. Blockhead-Hans tries to ride a goat instead of a horse, and ends up going down the road very quickly. His brothers are ahead of him, and they are planning what to say to him when he catches up. A man becomes king after playing a prank on an editor, and the editor's newspaper reports on it.

Last chunk: floor.  'Ah! are those the great people?' said Blockhead-Hans. 'Then I will give  the editor the best!' So saying, he turned his pockets inside out, and  threw the mud right in his face.  'That was neatly done!' said the Princess. 'I couldn't have done it; but  I will soon learn how to!'  Blockhead-Hans became King, got a wife and a crown, and sat on the  throne; and this we have still damp from the newspaper of the editor and  the reporters--and they are not to be believed for a moment.
