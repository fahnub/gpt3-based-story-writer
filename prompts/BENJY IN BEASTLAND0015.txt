Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Last chunk: Lion, "we will send some one down for Mr. Rough."  So they all waited, and in a little while they heard the jingling of Mr.  Rough's collar, and he walked into the circle with his little short tail  standing right up.  "Mr. Rough," said the Lion, "Benjy says it is you, and not he, who tease  and kill the cats."  "Well," said Mr. Rough, jumping about in an angry way, "am I to blame?
