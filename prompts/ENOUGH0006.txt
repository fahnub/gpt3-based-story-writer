Outline: Mrs. Ladybug is trying to take Jennie Junebug to task for eating the leaves of Farmer Green's trees, but Jennie is too rough and knocks the breath out of Mrs. Ladybug instead. Mrs. Ladybug sends Miss Moth to find Freddie Firefly and ask him for help. Freddie Firefly comes up with the idea to ask Jennie why she doesn't bump into Solomon Owl. Jennie likes the idea and does just that. Solomon Owl is not amused and goes looking for Jennie. Jennie hides until he leaves, then announces she is moving away and is never seen again on Farmer Green's property.

Story so far:  Freddie Firefly persuades Solomon Owl to fly down into the meadow, where he plans to make Solomon Owl collide with Jennie Junebug. A ladybug is angry with a Junebug for bowling her over and eating leaves from a farmer's garden. Mrs. Ladybug is trying to figure out how to stop Jennie Junebug from eating the leaves off Farmer Green's fruit trees. Freddie suggests that she just talk to Jennie and explain how she's affecting the trees. Mrs. Ladybug sends Miss Moth to find Freddie Firefly so she can talk to him about Jennie Junebug knocking the breath out of her. Freddie comes right away, and Mrs. Ladybug tells him that she needs help. Mrs. Ladybug asks Freddie Firefly to speak to Solomon Owl about Mrs. Mosquito's rude behavior. Freddie Firefly boasts that he is not afraid of Solomon Owl and that he could get Solomon Owl to stop Mrs. Mosquito's behavior. Jennie Junebug leaves Farmer Green's place to live at the end of the valley. Solomon Owl and Jennie Junebug have a disagreement, with JennieJunebug coming out the worse for it. Solomon Owl vows to find her and "fix her." Jennie Junebug, meanwhile, is hiding in the grass, hoping to avoid detection.

Last chunk: Owl with an awful thud. To  her huge surprise she fell headlong, while he merely paused in his low  flight.  "Who struck me?" he bawled.  "Jennie Junebug!" said Freddie Firefly.  "Where is she now?" Solomon hooted. "If I find her I'll fix her."  Jennie Junebug heard everything he said. She was lying hidden in the  grass near-by. And she wouldn't have come out for anything.  "I'll keep an eye out for her," Solomon Owl announced. "I come to the  meadow often, a-mousing."  Jennie Junebug kept still
