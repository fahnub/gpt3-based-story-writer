Outline: Cuffy Bear learns that there is such a thing as maple-sugar and that it tastes a hundred times better than the sweet sap from a sugar-maple tree. He also learns that he must stay away from men, especially Farmer Green.

Story so far:  Cuffy finds a sugar-maple tree and falls asleep. His father comes home and tells them all about maple-sugar. This passage describes how bears can find maple syrup by finding trees with buckets attached to them. Mr. Bear warns Cuffy not to go near the trees because Farmer Green collects the sap every day. Cuffy Bear gets a stomachache after not telling his parents about his adventure to the spring. Cuffy is asleep and sucking on his paw, presumably because he is thinking about the phrase "a hundred times better" from earlier in the night.

Last chunk: After he had gone to bed that night the words  kept ringing in Cuffy's ears. _A hundred times better! A hundred times  better!... A hundred_--And now Cuffy was fast asleep and--I am sorry to  say it--sucking one of his paws for all the world as if it was a piece  of Farmer Green's maple-sugar.
