Outline: Nimble is a young deer who is determined to try carrots for himself, after his mother tells him how delicious they are. He sets off for the carrot patch one night, but is waylaid by Jimmy Rabbit, who is busy eating cabbages. Jimmy reluctantly shows Nimble to the carrot patch, and then scampers off.

Nimble is disappointed to find that carrots are not as tasty as he was led to believe. He starts to leave the patch, but is pursued by Jimmy Rabbit, who is being chased by a dog. Nimble and Jimmy lose each other in the woods, and Nimble goes home empty-handed.

Jimmy Rabbit shows Nimble where the carrot patch is and tells him to help himself. Nimble is a Spike Horn who steals down to Farmer Green's garden one night and finds Jimmy Rabbit eating a cabbage.

Last chunk: Nimble's second summer rolled around he was big enough and old  enough to prowl through the woods and fields much as he pleased. He was  a Spike Horn. And he felt fit to go to the carrot patch without waiting  for anybody to show him the way.  So one night he stole down the hillside pasture, across the meadow, and  jumped the fence into Farmer Green's garden.  He saw at once that somebody was there ahead of him. It was Jimmy  Rabbit. He was very busy with one of Farmer Green's cabbages.  "I've
