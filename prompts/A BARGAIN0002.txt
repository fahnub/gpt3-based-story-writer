Outline: Jimmy Rabbit falls into a bog and calls for help, but Peter Mink pretends he can't hear him. Jimmy Rabbit finally gets his left hind-foot free and tries to pull himself out, but ends up sinking further in. Peter Mink finally comes over and Jimmy Rabbit bargains with him to get out, offering his left hind-foot in exchange. Peter Mink agrees but then tries to back out of the deal, so Jimmy Rabbit takes him to Mr. Crow to settle the matter.

Story so far:  Jimmy Rabbit falls into some mud and gets stuck. He calls for help, but Peter Mink doesn't hear him. When Peter finally does find Jimmy, he scolds him for not following him in the first place. Jimmy Rabbit agrees to give Peter Mink his left hind-foot, on the condition that Peter must always carry it in his pocket and agree to take care of Jimmy's family if anything happens to him. Peter Mink tells Jimmy Rabbit that the only way he will help him is if he gives him his left hind-foot, because he needs a lucky foot. Jimmy Rabbit and Peter Mink make a bargain that Peter will get all the luck if he cuts off Jimmy's left hind-foot. Jimmy Rabbit gets upset when Peter tries to go through with it and they argue. Jimmy is stuck in mud and trying to get his left hind-foot free.

Last chunk: of some way in which he  might escape.  It occurred to him that if he could only manage to get his left  hind-foot free of the mud (that was his lucky foot, you know) perhaps he  would be able to crawl out, somehow. With his lucky foot buried deep in  the mud, and quite out of sight, Jimmy thought it was not at all strange  that he had not been able to free himself.  So he tried to raise his left hind-foot. At first the mud actually  seemed to suck it deeper, as he tried. But after a long time
