Outline: Fatty Coon is a coon who likes to eat squirrels. The squirrels don't like him because he tries to eat them. One night, Fatty Coon climbs a tree in search of a squirrel to eat. He finds a hole in the tree and sticks his paw inside, only to be met with a sharp pain. He pulls his paw out to find that it was a tramp coon who had given him the pain. The tramp coon scolds Fatty and tells him to go home. Fatty goes home and never goes back to that tree again.

Story so far: Fatty Coon is a gluttonous creature who loves to eat bugs, snakes, and chickens. He is also known for playing tricks on others. In the passage, he meets up with two rabbits again and plays a trick on them, making them wait all afternoon for him. He becomes known as a robber, and Jasper Jay is the most annoying of all. One day, after he has devoured all the fish his mother has brought home for him, he nearly falls out of a tree and is scolded by an adult. The passage ends with Fatty Coon being confronted by a monster. Fatty Coon was climbing a chestnut tree when he found a hole in the trunk. He could hear something moving around inside, and he thought it was probably a squirrel. His eyes turned green with excitement. Fatty Coon was a very fat raccoon who loved to eat more than anything. This led to him having many adventures, especially near the swamp by his home. Fatty Coon liked to eat squirrels, but the squirrels didn't like him. They usually kept far away from him. The Coon family all look alike, with six black rings around their tails, a dark brown 'mask' of fur across their faces, and a stiff white moustache. Fatty is given the role of robber in a game of make-believe. He is to hide behind a tree and jump out when the other children walk by, saying "Hands up!" The passage describes Fatty Coon, a squirrel hunter who is also afraid of goshawks. Despite his fear, Fatty Coon continues to hunt squirrels at night and has even started to roam through the tree-tops.

Last chunk: little. And you couldn't say they were SAFE  in bed, because they never knew when Fatty Coon, or his mother, or his  brother, or one of his sisters, or some cousin of his, might come along  and catch them before they knew it.  Fatty thought it great sport to hunt squirrels at night. Whenever he  tried it he usually managed to get a good meal. And after he had almost  forgotten about the fright the goshawk had given him in the tall hemlock  he began to roam through the tree-tops every night in
