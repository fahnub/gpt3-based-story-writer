Outline: Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon attend a Rabbits' Ball without being invited. The guests are all blindfolded, and the dance is to be without music. Jimmy Rabbit, the host, is busy whispering to the other rabbits, telling them to take their blindfolds off and run away, because Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon are not supposed to be there.

Two by two, the rabbits take off their blindfolds and run away, until there are only three of the merrymakers left. Two of those are Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon, who are still dancing, still blindfolded, and each still thinking that the other is a rabbit. The third is Jimmy Rabbit himself. But he is not dancing. He is peeping out from behind a tree, and wondering what is going to happen.

Tommy Fox and his partner are blindfolded and bumping into other dancers, until they stop bumping into anyone. Jimmy Rabbit is busy doing something.

Last chunk: blindfolded, too.  At first, Tommy Fox and his partner kept bumping into other dancers.  That was natural enough, too, because how could anyone see, with a  pocket-handkerchief tied over his eyes?  After a while Tommy noticed that they bumped into fewer and fewer  people, until at last they never ran into any others at all. But he  never stopped to wonder at that.
