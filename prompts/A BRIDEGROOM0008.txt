Outline: Daddy Longlegs is taken by surprise when he is suddenly visited by a group of his friends, who inform him that they are going to call him by a different name - 'Grandfather Graybeard'. Daddy Longlegs is pleased with his new name, but his friends are soon interrupted by the arrival of a large lady, who is also of Daddy Longlegs' kind. The lady is not pleased with the new name, and she insists that Daddy Longlegs withdraw his consent. Poor Daddy Longlegs is forced to agree, and he follows the lady away. His friends are left confused and bewildered.

Later, little Mrs. Ladybug arrives and explains that Daddy Longlegs has a new wife. Therefore, the 'bride' would not want her husband to be known as 'Grandfather Graybeard'. With this new information, the friends of Daddy Longlegs finally understand the situation and they all go their separate ways.

Daddy Longlegs is pleased with the new name. Daddy Longlegs follows a strange lady away and his friends are worried because she is much bigger than him. Little Mrs. Ladybug arrives and is out of breath from hurrying. A group of insects surprises Daddy Longlegs by visiting him early in the morning.
