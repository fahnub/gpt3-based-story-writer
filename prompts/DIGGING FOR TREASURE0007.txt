Outline: Seven friends are digging for treasure in the garden when they suddenly fall into a hidden tunnel. One of the boys, Albert, is buried under the rubble. The others frantically dig him out and he is unharmed but upset. They all share the two half-crowns they find as treasure.

Story so far:  This passage tells us that the best part of books (and real life) is when things are happening, not when people are just talking. The author says they won't bore us with all the days when nothing happened, because that would be pointless. Alice and Dora discuss the meaning of "moral force", which is the ability to influence others through methods such as shaming, mockery, or bribery. Albert-next-door's uncle interrupts and asks them to explain what happened to Albert. Dora says that she is sorry it happened to him, and that she would have preferred it if it had happened to someone else. The speaker was supposed to go into the tunnel to dig for treasure, but they didn't because they don't like worms. They were just about to reach the underground passage to the secret hoard when the tunnel fell in on Albert. Two children are digging for treasure in their backyard, when their neighbor Albert comes over. He is uninterested in their treasure hunt, and only laughs at them.

Last chunk: to orphans, even if their mothers are  alive. Albert is always very tidy. He wears frilly collars and velvet  knickerbockers. I can't think how he can bear to.  So we said, 'Hallo!'  And he said, 'What are you up to?'  'We're digging for treasure,' said Alice; 'an ancient parchment revealed  to us the place of concealment. Come over and help us. When we have  dug deep enough we shall find a great pot of red clay, full of gold and  precious jewels.'  Albert-next-door only sniggered and said,
