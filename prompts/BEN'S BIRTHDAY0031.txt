Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

Last chunk: all the glory without giving his  little friend a share.  "You must wear it; I shall feel real mean if you don't. You worked  harder than I did, and it was only luck my getting this. Do, Bab, to  please me," he persisted, awkwardly trying to fasten the ornament in the  middle of Bab's' white apron.  "Then I will. Now do you forgive me for losing Sancho?" asked Bab, with  a wistful look which made Ben say, heartily,--  "I did that when he came home."  "And you don't think I'm horrid?"  "Not a bit
