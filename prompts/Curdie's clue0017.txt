Story so far:  The goblins were surprised and afraid to see Curdie with a pick in his hand, thinking he was the first of an invasion of miners. The king strutted up to Curdie and tried to intimidate him. A man named Curdie enters a palace through a hole in the mountain, and is confronted by the king. Curdie explains that he is a miner and found his pickaxe lying on the ground. The king allows Curdie to stay in the palace. The queen, king, and minister laugh at Harelip for considering an operation to fix her harelip. The king summoned goblins with a shout, and they gathered around him in a way that made him retreat. Curdie was attacked by a goblin woman, who he managed to hurt by stamping on her foot with his own. However, she quickly retaliated, causing him great pain. The only way he could have defeated her would have been to attack her shoes with his pickaxe. Curdie was surrounded by a group of strange creatures, but he was able to fight them off with his axe.

When she laughs, her small mouth opens wide. The passage describes a girl with very large ears, who is trying to eavesdrop on a conversation. However, she accidentally falls and makes a lot of noise. The goblins get angry and start to chase her.

But whether he was not careful enough,  or the projection gave way, down he came with a rush on the floor of  the cavern, bringing with him a great rumbling shower of stones.  The goblins jumped from their seats in more anger
