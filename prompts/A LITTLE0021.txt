Outline: The story is set in a poor, inner-city neighborhood, and revolves around the local Kindergarten. The protagonist is Patsy, a young boy who has been living a rough, tough life on the streets. Patsy is taken in by the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Kate, and quickly becomes devoted to her and the school. He takes on the role of caretaker and protector, and is a loyal and obedient student.

Patsy is also friends with Jim, another boy from the neighborhood. Jim is older than Patsy and is starting to get interested in girls. He tells Patsy that he wants to find a girl to marry, and Patsy helps him look.

One day, Patsy confides in Miss Kate that he is worried about what will happen to him when he has to leave the Kindergarten and go to "real school." Miss Kate reassures him and tells him that he is welcome to stay at the Kindergarten forever.

The story ends with Patsy and Jim getting married, and Miss Kate attending their wedding.
