Outline: Buster Bumblebee's mother, the Queen, is worried that her workers won't make enough honey for the family's needs. Buster Bumblebee speaks up and says that he knows of a plan that could help - the honey-makers could work after dark if the Firefly family furnished lights for them.

The Queen liked the idea and sent Buster to talk with Freddie Firefly. Freddie Firefly agreed to help and soon the honey-makers were able to work after dark. Buster Bumblebee was very proud of himself and his successful plan.

Story so far:  Buster is released from something and barely manages to save himself from falling. He hears a loud buzz and hides among the clover leaves. The uproar eventually stops. Buster Bumblebee is excited to hear about a raising bee at the farmhouse, and decides to go see it the next day. Jimmy Rabbit would also like to go, but is unsure if he'll have the time. Buster Bumblebee was initially afraid of the Robber Fly, but over time he became less fearful and realized that the Fly was not a threat. Buster is having a great time at Farmer Green's party and has forgotten all about the raising bee.

Last chunk: his best to keep time to the music and wishing that he had  brought some of his friends along with him to Farmer Green's party.  As for the raising bee, Buster had completely forgotten it. He was having  so much fun at the dance that the real reason for his coming to Farmer  Green's place had quite slipped out of his mind.
