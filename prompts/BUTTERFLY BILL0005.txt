Outline: Betsy Butterfly and Mrs. Ladybug are surrounded by a crowd of field people who are curious about the dust on Betsy's wings. Butterfly Bill, a cousin of Betsy's, tells Mrs. Ladybug that the dust is what gives butterflies their beautiful colors and that if she tries to brush it off, she'll have every one of them in her hair. Mrs. Ladybug is upset and drops her brush.

Bill then tells Mrs. Ladybug that there is a rumor going around that her house is on fire and that her children are in danger. Mrs. Ladybug starts weeping, and Bill tells her that she ought to mind her own business.

Jennie Junebug arrives on the scene and overhears Bill. She threatens to knock him down if he was talking about her or Mrs. Ladybug. Bill denies it and flees in terror.

Mrs. Ladybug comments on what a peculiar lot the Butterfly family is.

He then proceeds to make a speech about how Mrs. Ladybug is a meddling busybody who should mind her own business.
