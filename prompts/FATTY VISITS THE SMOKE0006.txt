Outline: Fatty Coon is a raccoon who is very thin after a long winter of sleeping. He decides to go to Farmer Green's house to see if he can find anything to eat. He smells something delicious coming from a small, low building and goes inside. He finds a row of hams hung up to smoke and starts to eat one. Suddenly, he is thrown to the ground and the ham falls on top of him. He is very frightened and runs all the way home. He later realizes that he had simply bitten through the cord that was holding the ham up, and it fell on him when he tried to take a bite. His children love hearing the story of his adventure.

Story so far:  Fatty would have eaten an elephant if he had the chance. He was very excited to find a ham and ate it quickly. The passage describes a man who is very hungry and does well with only one ham. He makes a hole in the ham and is about to keep going when he is suddenly thrown to the floor and the ham falls on top of him. He choked and sputtered from the ashes but soon managed to kick the ham off.

Last chunk: hungry. But he did very well, with only ONE. In no time at all he had  made a great hole in the ham. And he had no idea of stopping. But he did  stop. He stopped very suddenly. For the first thing he knew, something  threw him right down upon the floor. And the ham fell on top of him and  nearly knocked him senseless.  He choked and spluttered; for the ashes filled his mouth and his eyes,  and his ears, too. For a moment he lay there on his back; but soon he  managed to kick the heavy ham off
