Outline: Eva is a young girl who is very ill. Her uncle, Tom, is a slave who loves her very much and takes care of her. Eva knows she is going to die soon and she makes her uncle promise to free him when she dies.

A few nights later, Eva dies in her sleep. True to his promise, Mr. St. Clare goes to his lawyer to start the process of freeing Tom. He tells Tom to pack his things and get ready to go home.

While Tom is waiting for Mr. St. Clare to come home from a ride, he falls asleep on the verandah. He is awakened by a loud knock at the gate and he runs to open it. It is Mr. St. Clare, who has been in an accident and is dying.

Tom stays with Mr. St. Clare until he dies, and then he goes home to his wife and children as a free man.

Story so far:  Eva is very ill and everyone tries to make her comfortable. Tom expresses his preference for having his own poor belongings over having the best belongings that belong to someone else. St. Clare comments that he doesn't understand why Tom feels this way, but accepts it. In the passage, Mr. St. Clare is asked whose slave Topsy is, to which he replies that she is the slave of whoever purchased her. The person asking then says that they would like Mr. St. Clare to give them a paper stating that Topsy is theirs, to which Mr. St. Clare agrees. Mr. St. Clare had been in an accident and was dying. The passage describes how a slave would sing hymns with his young mistress, and how he eventually gave up sleeping in his bed to sleep outside her door. One day, she cut off a lot of her hair and gave it to him as a parting gift.

Last chunk: that he could do it very easily. He would walk about with her under the orange-trees in the garden, or sitting down on some of their old seats, would sing their favorite hymns.  He loved to do it, and could not bear to be long away from his little mistress. He gave up sleeping in his bed, and lay all night on the mat outside her door.  One day Eva made her aunt cut off a lot of her beautiful hair. Then she called all the slaves together, said good-bye to them, and gave them each a curl of her
