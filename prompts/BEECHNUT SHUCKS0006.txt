Outline: Frisky Squirrel is visiting Farmer Green's place and is looking for some beechnuts. He finds some beechnut shucks near the woodshed door and begins to nibble on them. Miss Kitty Cat, who is inside the woodshed, smells the squirrel and begins to stalk him. Frisky Squirrel smells the cat and tries to escape, but the cat catches him.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow tells Frisky the Squirrel to turn back because there is a cat at the farmhouse. A squirrel smells a beechnut and falls over when he sees a cat in the doorway.

Last chunk: Squirrel's nose twitched  again, as he muttered to himself, "There's a very queer smell about  these beechnut shucks!"  He was sitting on the edge of the stone doorstep with a bit of beechnut  clutched in his paws. And when he looked up and saw somebody's nose  appear in the doorway he tumbled right over backward. The only sound he  made came from the beechnut shuck, which made a faint click as it fell  upon the stone. And Miss Kitty Cat's sharp ears caught it.
