Outline: Mrs. Ladybug tells Freddie Firefly that he should spend his nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the trains. Freddie is hesitant at first, but Mrs. Ladybug assures him that he will be able to stop the trains before they run over him. Freddie decides to try it out and sets off for the railroad track. When he gets there, he waves his light in front of an oncoming train. The train does not stop and Freddie is killed.

Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug tells Freddie Firefly that he should stop worrying and start working if he doesn't want to waste his time. Freddie is doubtful about whether he can fly all the way to the railroad, but Mrs. Ladybug insists that he can. Freddie Firefly liked Mrs. Ladybug's idea, and though he knew she was mistaken about some things, he began to think she was quite wise. A man sees a ladybug and waves at her as he walks towards the village. In this fable, Freddie Firefly asks little Mrs. Ladybug what could happen if the wind blew out his light. Mrs. Ladybug replies that the train would strike him and be wrecked. She explains that she has everything planned for him, and that he will spend his nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the trains.

Last chunk: ALL ABOUT TRAINS (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    "What do you mean?" Freddie Firefly asked little Mrs. Ladybug. "What  accident could happen if the wind blew out my light?" And he laughed  very hard, because he knew that no gale was strong enough even to dim  his greenish-white gleams.  "Why," replied Mrs. Ladybug, "the train would strike you and be wrecked.  You see," she continued, "I have everything planned for you. You're  going to spend your nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the  trains."
