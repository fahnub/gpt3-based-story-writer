Outline: Johnnie Green sees Mr. Turtle and chases after him. He catches up to Mr. Turtle and traps him with a stick. Johnnie Green is unsure of what to do with Mr. Turtle, but he eventually decides to flip him over on his back. Johnnie Green leaves Mr. Turtle there, unable to move. Mr. Crow arrives and hears Timothy's remarks.

Story so far: Mr. Crow is angry with Jasper Jay for using his umbrella, but Jasper Jay is unphased. He points out that Mr. Crow is the one who looks like he got caught in a shower, not him. Mr. Crow promises never to use the umbrella again. Polly looks for Freddie Firefly after her friends set her free, but he stays hidden. Henrietta Hen tells Mr. Crow that if he wants to know the answer to his question, he should ask the Rooster. The Rooster will give him an answer that he won't like. After trying to rouse his family by knocking on the door, Freddie Firefly's efforts are in vain as they are all too deeply asleep. The family trumpeter later claims to have dreamt that she heard somebody at the door that night. Mr. Crow is a crow who is happy because he gets to eat all the corn he wants. One day, he notices that the scarecrow is gone and there is a new, shorter figure in its place. Mr. Crow does not pay much attention to the new figure. Farmer Green did not shoot the rabbit, but he was very scared.

Last chunk: all day. And so anybody can see how frightened he was....  Farmer Green walked home to his own breakfast with his gun resting upon  his shoulder.  "I didn't get him," he told Johnnie. "But I must have scared him out of a  year's growth."
