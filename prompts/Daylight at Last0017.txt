Outline: The Ork, Cap'n Bill, and Trot have finally escaped the underground tunnels and find themselves on an island. They're not sure where they are, but they're relieved to be out of the tunnels. They explore the island and find that it is full of fruit trees. They also find a shed-like structure that may be a house. They go to investigate and find that it is indeed a house. There is no one there, but there is a bed and some other furniture. They decide to stay there and see if anyone comes to the island.

They will not starve while they are on the island. The little girl sees a shed and suggests to Cap'n Bill that they build a raft or boat to sail away in.

Last chunk: island, too," said Cap'n Bill, trying to conceal his  disappointment on Trot's account. "I guess, partner, if the wuss comes  to the wuss, I could build a raft--or even a boat--from those trees,  so's we could sail away in it."  The little girl brightened at this suggestion. "I don't see the Ork  anywhere," she remarked, looking around. Then her eyes lighted upon  something and she exclaimed: "Oh, Cap'n Bill! Isn't that a house, over  there to the left?"
