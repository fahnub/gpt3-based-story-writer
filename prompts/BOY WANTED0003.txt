Outline: Rusty Wren's wife is still shaken up after being frightened by Jasper Jay dropping cherries on her house. Rusty takes it upon himself to find food for their six children, and he works tirelessly to do so. However, as the children grow, they need more and more food, and Rusty realizes he won't be able to keep up. He comes up with the idea to get somebody to help him, and his wife reluctantly agrees. Rusty hangs a sign that says "Boy Wanted" and soon enough, a young bird named Freddy Finch comes along and applies for the job. Freddy is a hard worker and a quick learner, and Rusty's wife soon warms up to him. The family is doing well until one day, Freddy doesn't come home from work. Rusty and his wife worry all night, and the next day they set out to find Freddy. They eventually find him lying on the ground, sick and injured. They take him back to their home and nurse him back to health, and Freddy is soon part of the family for good.

Story so far:  Rusty's wife does not want to stay alone in the house at night with six small children, so Rusty plans to get somebody to help him. The passage describes a man who is growing thin and his wife who is worried about their children's future. Rusty Wren's wife is still shaken after Jasper Jay dropped cherries on their roof, and Rusty realizes she needs a break. Rusty Wren agrees to find food for his six hungry children while his wife rests, even though he knows it will be a difficult task. Rusty Wren was always busy bringing food home to his family, and now they were half starved.

Last chunk: always  clamoring for more food. And now they seemed half starved, for they  had had nothing to eat all the time that Jasper Jay had kept Rusty  and his wife hiding in their house.  Rusty Wren, however, was not one to complain, no matter what  happened. And every day from dawn till dark he hurried out of the  house to find some toothsome insect, and bring it home to drop it  into somebody's yawning mouth.  Indeed, he was so busy feeding his family that he scarcely had a  chance to eat anything
