It is  not the first time I have been in a cage; and I do not think they will  tie ME with cords."  "Be wise, then," said Mowgli, laughing; for he was beginning to feel as  reckless as the panther, who had glided into the hut.  "Pah!" Bagheera grunted. "This place is rank with Man, but here is just  such a bed as they gave me to lie upon in the King's cages at Oodeypore.  Now I
