Outline: Henrietta Hen is scratching for worms in a freshly ploughed and harrowed field when she is caught by Mr. Crow. He accuses her of stealing corn and she doesn't deny it. When he asks her why she doesn't speak, she tells him she is too proud to talk with him and that she doesn't care to be seen speaking to him. She tells him to ask the Rooster if he wants to know the answer to his question. She walks away with stately steps and Mr. Crow watches her with a baleful gleam in his eyes.

Story so far:  The old gentleman in the passage is complaining about Farmer Green wasting corn on Henrietta Hen. He wishes he was a speckled hen himself so that he could enjoy the same treatment.

Last chunk: anything more dangerous than harsh words.  "I don't know what the farm's coming to," he croaked. "Here's Farmer  Green wasting corn on such as her--and cracking it for her, too!"  So saying, the old gentleman turned his back on Henrietta Hen, who was  already fluttering through the farmyard fence. And thereupon he scratched  up enough corn for a hearty meal, grumbling meanwhile because it wasn't  cracked for him.  "Somehow," he muttered, "I can't help wishing I was a speckled hen."
