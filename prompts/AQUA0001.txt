Outline: Aqua is a water droplet who lives in the ocean with his mother. He grows tired of playing in the ocean and begs the sun to take him on a journey to see the earth. The sun agrees and transforms Aqua into vapor so that he can ride on the sunbeams.

Aqua has a grand time sailing through the air and looking down at the world below, but when the sun sets he grows scared and tries to return to the ocean. He falls back to earth and lands in a rosebush. The next day he tries again and this time he ends up in a flour mill, where he and his fellow water droplets work the machinery.

Eventually Aqua and his brothers end up in a river which leads them back to the ocean. Aqua is happy to be back home with his mother and tells her all about his adventures.

Story so far:  A man and his brothers run to a mountain brook and hear a strange noise. They find a flour mill and see that the big wheel is making the stones inside spin really fast. This fable is about a water baby who is both above and below the surface of the water, and is stirred by the life around him.
