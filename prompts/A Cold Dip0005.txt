Outline: In this fable, Peter Mink is a creature who enjoys swimming and spends a lot of time near water sources in Pleasant Valley. One winter day, he decides to take a swim in the brook. Master Meadow Mouse, another creature in the valley, is also aware of Peter Mink's swimming habits and knows that he likes to swim under the ice.

 Master Meadow Mouse is determined to take a cold dip himself, despite the danger of encountering Peter Mink. He is careful, peeking out of his tunnel to look for Peter Mink before he ventures out. However, one day Peter Mink is too quick for him and Master Meadow Mouse is forced to retreat back into his tunnel.

Despite the close call, Master Meadow Mouse continues to take cold dips in the brook. One day, he is joined by a member of the Muskrat family, who are also aware of the danger of Peter Mink. The Muskrat gives a loud slap on the water's surface with its tail as a warning signal when it sees Peter Mink, and Master Meadow Mouse is able to safely enjoy his swim.

Master Meadow Mouse always felt safer when one of the Muskrat family happened to be taking a swim at the same time, because they had a warning signal that told everybody when there was danger.

Last chunk: water's edge and  plunge in.  To tell the truth, Master Meadow Mouse always felt safer when one of  the Muskrat family happened to be taking a swim at the same time. For  the Muskrats all had a warning signal that told everybody when there was  danger. When one of them caught sight of Peter Mink he never failed--if  he was in the water--to give a loud slap upon the surface with his tail.  Master Meadow Mouse always had one ear that was listening for that slap.  And when it sounded he never
