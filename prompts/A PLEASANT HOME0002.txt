Outline: Rusty Wren and his wife are looking for a new home. Rusty finds an old hollow apple tree and a hole in a fence-rail, but his wife doesn't want to live so far from the farmhouse. She suggests that they build their nest behind one of the shutters, but Rusty is worried that somebody might come to the window and close the shutter, causing their nest to fall.

Rusty eventually finds a perfect spot for their nest nailed to a tree close to Farmer Green's bedroom window. His wife is delighted and they move in right away.

Story so far:  A wren couple argue over where to build their nest, the wife wanting to be close to the farmhouse while the husband wants to be further away. The passage describes a man's excitement at finding the perfect spot to build a house in Pleasant Valley. Mrs. Rusty is less excited, asking only if the location is in a good neighborhood. The man assures her it is, and she expresses some doubt at the idea of living in a hole in a tree. Rusty and his wife discuss where they should build their nest for the summer. Rusty's wife wants to build it near the farmhouse, while Rusty would prefer a more secluded spot. In the end, they agree that Rusty will find a suitable location for their nest.

Last chunk: "Somebody might come to the window and  close the shutter; and then our nest would fall to the ground. And  if we happened to have six or eight eggs in it, you know you  wouldn't like that very well."  Rusty's wife agreed with him on that point. But she still insisted  that she wanted to live near the farmhouse; and she said that she  expected her husband to find a good spot for their nest, for she  certainly wasn't going to spend the summer in a hole in a  fence-rail, or in an old apple tree,
