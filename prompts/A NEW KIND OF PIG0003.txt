Outline: Grunty Pig tumbles through a hole in a fence and is found by old dog Spot, who promises to show him twelve pigs without tails. Grunty is amazed to find that the pigs in the cage have no tails, and he accuses old Spot of trying to trick him. Johnnie Green, the owner of the pigs, comes out and tells them to leave. Grunty and Spot don't see each other for a week, and when they finally meet again, Spot is ashamed of himself for what he did.

Story so far:  Spot the dog leads Grunty Pig to a dozen pigs without tails and tells Grunty that he should ask Farmer Green to be like them. Grunty Pig and old Spot meet and have a conversation in which Grunty Pig asks old Spot why he doesn't have his own tail cut off. Johnnie Green comes out of the woodshed and tells them to get away from his guinea pigs. The old dog Spot tells the protagonist that the pigs they are looking at will never have tails, and that the protagonist should have their own tail cut off since they would be just as happy without one. Grunty turns on Spot, accusing him of lying about the pigs they're looking at. Spot insists they are pigs, and Grunty eventually concedes that they must be very young ones. Grunty Pig is surprised to see that the twelve little, pudgy, white strangers have no tails. The passage describes a pigsty that has been converted into a two-story cage. The pig in the cage, Grunty Pig, is wondering what the farmer meant when he said "cut off your tail and nail it up on the barn." Spot never mentioned tails again after trying to play a trick on Grunty Pig. Grunty Pig sees some creatures in a cage, but he thinks they look peculiar because he can't tell what's missing about them.

Last chunk: beside Spot, Grunty Pig peered inside the cage. He saw a number  of odd little creatures running about upon the sawdust-strewn floor of  the tiny house, one or another of them giving a faint squeak now and  then as if ordering the two unasked callers to move on.  Whoever they were, they were a bright-eyed little family. But Grunty  Pig thought, as he stared at them, that they had a most peculiar look.  There seemed to be something missing about them. Yet he couldn't tell  just what it was.
