Outline: Dorothy and her friends are sitting in the throne room of the royal palace in the Emerald City, awaiting the arrival of the invited guests for Ozma's birthday celebration. The first to arrive are the gingerbread man, King Dough the First, and his head booleywag (a child-like creature), Chick the Cherub, followed by a rubber bear. They are all from the Kingdoms of Hiland and Loland and Dorothy introduces them to the others.

Next to arrive is a tall, beautiful woman clad in an exquisite trailing gown - the Sorceress known as Glinda the Good. She is warmly welcomed by all and escorted to her room by fifty servants.

Then comes Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T.E., head professor at the Royal College of Oz, who wishes to read an Ode he has composed in honor of Ozma's birthday; but the Scarecrow won't let him.

After that, Billina and her ten fluffy chicks enter the room and Dorothy runs down from her seat to pet them. They are all wearing lockets with her picture inside.

Lastly, Tik-tok the clock-work man comes in, all wound up and working fine. He is followed by a procession of more foreign dignitaries and the High Chamberlain announces each of them as they enter.

When all the guests have arrived, they are seated and a feast is served. After the meal, there is much merriment and dancing and the guests enjoy themselves immensely. As the evening draws to a close, they all retire to their rooms and the palace is quiet once more.

He is pleased to have been able to have it done. This passage describes a group of curious visitors, including a gingerbread man with licorice buttons and a big rubber bear. Dorothy, the Tin Woodman, and the Scarecrow receive Tik-tok, a clockwork man, and Billina, a hen, in the throne room. Dorothy and her friends meet the Scarecrow, who is very popular and well-known.

When asked if it is a boy or a girl, Button-Bright replies that they don't know. The yellow hen had pictures of Dorothy in every locket of her chickens and named them after her. When she called them, they all came running to her.

Last chunk: outside.  "Open the lockets, Dorothy," said Billina.  The girl obeyed and found a  picture of herself in each locket.  "They were named after you, my  dear," continued the Yellow Hen, "so I wanted all my chickens to wear  your picture.  Cluck--cluck! come here, Dorothy--this minute!" she  cried, for the chickens were scattered and wandering all around the big  room.
