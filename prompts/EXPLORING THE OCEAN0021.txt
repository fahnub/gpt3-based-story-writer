Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far: The passage describes a meal with unknown dishes, which the child is suspicious of. Cap'n Bill eats everything without questioning it, so the child decides to do the same. Trot and Cap'n Bill learn that the ice cream they are eating comes from icebergs. The eels in the passage are discussing their plans to scare an old mermaid, and one eel says that they know how to be polite to company so they won't hurt the guests. The passage describes a meeting between two groups of creatures, one group being land-dwellers and the other group being water-dwellers. The water-dwellers are initially confused by the land-dwellers, but they soon realize that the land-dwellers are just visiting and are not a threat. The passage describes how Queen Aquareine and her people cook their food using the sun's rays. They don't need fires, as the sun provides all the heat they need. Trot is surprised by this, as she didn't think it was possible to cook without a fire. The little barnacles referred to in the passage are actually a type of clam. They are known for their ability to cling to ships. The barnacles in the passage are singing a song that, according to the mermaid, usually has no meaning. However, the child asks if they write comic operas, to which the mermaid replies that they seem to enjoy the songs they sing. A sailor encounters an eel, which snaps at his face. The eel is unafraid of the mermaids, who have the power to stiffen them. The passage describes water as being alive and beautiful, with a variety of colors. The child in the passage sees the water as being like jelly, and is fascinated by its ability to move in any direction. The passage describes two fish guarding an avenue in a sea garden. When asked if all is quiet, one of the guards reports that a third fish was sick earlier but is better now and has gone to sleep.
