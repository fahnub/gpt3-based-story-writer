Outline: The story is about a darning-needle who believes she is an embroidery-needle and is very proud. She is being used by the fingers to sew a shoe upper leather and is not happy with the common work. She breaks and is then stuck in the front of the cook's dress with sealing-wax. She is now a breast-pin and is very proud of herself. She talks to a bit of bottle-glass and they both think they are very costly. The bit of bottle-glass is washed away and the darning-needle is left. Two boys find her and stick her in an egg-shell. A wagon-wheel goes over her but she does not break.

She is proud and doesn't lose her temper, but she does think that the other objects are foolish for not knowing what is beneath them. A darning needle is telling the story of five brothers, all called "Fingers." The outside one, the thumb, was short and fat and not as useful as the others. Dip-into-everything, the second finger, was the opposite and could do many things.

Last chunk: bottle-glass.  'Of noble birth!' said the Darning-needle; 'no indeed, but proud! They  were five brothers, all called ''Fingers.'' They held themselves proudly  one against the other, although they were of different sizes.
