Outline: The Story Girl came up with the idea to have everyone in their group write down their dreams in an exercise book, to see who could have the most interesting collection. They began writing down their dreams, but quickly realized that they were all having the same dream. In the dream, they were in a dark forest, being chased by a Giant. They would all wake up just before the Giant caught them. This continued for several nights until they realized that the Giant was actually Uncle Roger. They confronted him and he admitted that he had been purposely giving them all the same dream in order to scare them.

Story so far: This passage tells the story of a married couple who quarreled over the type of apple tree they had planted in their orchard. The husband eventually told his wife to "shut up," not knowing that it was impolite to say this to one's spouse. In the passage, Felicity and Peter discuss what would happen if Felicity's Aunt Olivia got married. Felicity believes that Aunt Olivia will never get married because she is already quite old (29 years old). However, Peter argues that she might find someone who doesn't mind her age. Cecily and her friends are excited about the idea of a wedding in the family, and they point out the wedding veil of the proud princess in the sky. Dan and the Story Girl discuss Mrs. Richard Cook and her grandmother. Cecily and Peter are discussing dreams, and the Story Girl suggests that they write them down. Cecily is inspired by the idea, and they all agree to do it. The speaker loves words and cherishes them like precious jewels. She takes great care in choosing the perfect word for each situation, and is not afraid to experiment. Felicity, on the other hand, is more practical and down-to-earth. She thinks the speaker is being too fanciful and insists that they use a more suitable word in this case. Peter is angry with his father for leaving his mother and does not care if he never comes back. The Story Girl suggests that perhaps his father will come back with a fortune, but Peter is doubtful.

Last chunk: care."  "Oh, Peter, that sounds dreadful," said Cecily. "Your own father!"  "Well," said Peter defiantly, "if your own father had run away when  you was a baby, and left your mother to earn her living by washing and  working out, I guess you wouldn't care much about him either."  "Perhaps your father may come home some of these days with a huge  fortune," suggested the Story Girl.  "Perhaps pigs may whistle, but they've poor mouths for it," was all the  answer Peter deigned to this charming
