Outline: Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon attend a Rabbits' Ball without being invited. The guests are all blindfolded, and the dance is to be without music. Jimmy Rabbit, the host, is busy whispering to the other rabbits, telling them to take their blindfolds off and run away, because Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon are not supposed to be there.

Two by two, the rabbits take off their blindfolds and run away, until there are only three of the merrymakers left. Two of those are Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon, who are still dancing, still blindfolded, and each still thinking that the other is a rabbit. The third is Jimmy Rabbit himself. But he is not dancing. He is peeping out from behind a tree, and wondering what is going to happen.

Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon continue to dance, and the fat lady (Fatty Coon) steps on Tommy's feet. Tommy gets angry and tells her to be careful. Fatty Coon gets angry and tells Tommy he's a great, clumsy creature. Tommy retorts that Fatty can't dance any better than a coon.

At that, Fatty Coon and Tommy Fox both take off their blindfolds and masks, and they see that they've been tricked. They jump at each other, and Jimmy Rabbit takes off running. That was the last time that Fatty Coon and Tommy Fox ever went to a party to which they were not invited. Jimmy Rabbit had taught them a lesson.

Story so far:  The passage describes how a fox and a raccoon trick the rabbits at a ball by pretending to be rabbits themselves. The rabbits are eventually convinced to run away, leaving the fox and raccoon to dance together. Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon are both upset after realizing they've been tricked by the other. Jimmy Rabbit taught Fatty Coon and Tommy Fox a lesson by showing them that it is not polite to attend a party without an invitation. The passage discusses teaching children a lesson. Tommy Fox is hiding behind a tree, watching as Jimmy Rabbit's guests dance. He gets angry when the fat lady steps on his feet, and tells her to be careful. She gets mad and tells him not to tell her how to dance. Tommy Fox is dancing with Fatty Coon, who is a terrible dancer. He keeps wishing the music would start so he can stop dancing.

Last chunk: A Dance Without Music (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    [Illustration: 18 A Dance Without Music]    As soon as Tommy Fox began to dance with the strange lady (she was  really Fatty Coon, you know), he saw very quickly that she was not a  good dancer at all. She kept stepping on Tommy's feet, and tripping him.  And Tommy kept wishing that the music would begin, so he could stop  dancing. You remember that Jimmy Rabbit had said that this was to be a  dance _without_ music, and that everybody had to be
