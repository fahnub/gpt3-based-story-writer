Outline: This is a playful poem about a child who is eager to eat their meal. The child is excited about the food they are going to have and the prospect of eating it. The poem speaks to the child's innocence and their joy in the simple things in life.

Story so far: The passage describes animals with various personality traits and how they act in different situations. Katy is a secret nobody knows about, except for Kiddie Katydid and his family. Many people remembered hearing her name mentioned the year before, but had forgotten about her until the Katydids brought her back to their minds in August. Grunty tumbles through a fence and runs to his mother, crying that a bear chased him. Mrs. Pig is excited and relieved that her son is not fat enough to have been caught by the bear. The passage describes how Mrs. Pig was delighted with the new improvement of the children eating in the most orderly fashion. Grunty liked the new way of eating, too. But Blackie made a great fuss. Grunty Pig's mother is worried about a bear prowling around the farm, and she doesn't want her son to go and tell Farmer Green about it. Cousin Rain and Brother Dust are racing, but Brother Dust falls down and can't continue. Mrs. Pig scolds Grunty for straying away from the farmyard and tells him that the bear chase was a good thing because it will keep him at home.

Last chunk: had somewhat recovered from her flurry, she called to  Grunty. And looking at him severely Mrs. Pig said to him, "Let this be a  lesson to you. Never, never stray away from the farmyard again!"  "Yes, Mother!" was Grunty's glib reply. Then he sidled away. Somehow he  felt uneasy under his mother's gaze.  "Perhaps it was a good thing, after all, that the bear chased him,"  Mrs. Pig muttered. "Maybe this fright will keep him at home."  She soon discovered that it would take more than a mere fright
