Outline: Mrs. Ladybug tells Freddie Firefly that he should spend his nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the trains. Freddie is hesitant at first, but Mrs. Ladybug assures him that he will be able to stop the trains before they run over him. Freddie decides to try it out and sets off for the railroad track. When he gets there, he waves his light in front of an oncoming train. The train does not stop and Freddie is killed.

Story so far:  Mrs. Ladybug tells Freddie Firefly that he should stop worrying and start working if he doesn't want to waste his time. Freddie is doubtful about whether he can fly all the way to the railroad, but Mrs. Ladybug insists that he can. Freddie Firefly liked Mrs. Ladybug's idea, and though he knew she was mistaken about some things, he began to think she was quite wise.

Last chunk: Well, Freddie Firefly rather liked Mrs. Ladybug's idea. And though he  knew that she was mistaken about some things, he began to think that  perhaps she was quite wise, after all.  "Aren't you afraid I might set fire to the trains?" he inquired slyly.  "No, indeed!" she answered. "You'd stop them, you know, before they ran  over you."  "But I don't know how to make a train stop," he objected. "I've never  worked on a railroad in all my life."  "Why, it's simple enough," said little Mrs. Ladybug.
