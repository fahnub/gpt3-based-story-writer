Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is exploring the world outside of his nest for the first time and is amazed by all the new sights and sounds. His mother warns him of the dangers of venturing too far from home, but he doesn't listen and eventually meets a kitten from the farmhouse. The kitten is friendly at first, but then tries to catch Master Meadow Mouse. He barely escapes and runs all the way home to his mother. She scolds him and he promises to never wander too far from home again.

Story so far:  The passage describes a child's curiosity about the sky, and their surprise at how big and far away it seems when they finally get a chance to touch it. Master Meadow Mouse's earliest memory is of lying in a nest of dried grasses in darkness or light, depending on whether it was night or day. He could see a shaft of light coming through a hole in the ceiling, and beyond that was the sky. Mrs. Meadow Mouse took her son above ground and taught him how to find food and stay safe. He eventually began to wander further from home, thinking his mother was too careful. Master Meadow Mouse decided to mind his mother after she asked him a question, even though he didn't know what had happened to his siblings. He wondered if the mysterious Henry Hawk had had anything to do with their disappearance. Master Meadow Mouse proved to be a hearty eater. Master Meadow Mouse discovers a new world and doesn't want to leave when his mother comes to find him. He ignores her warnings and then meets a kitten. Mrs. Meadow Mouse tells her son that he wouldn't know their neighbor if he saw him, and that he needs to stay in the nest until she comes home.

Last chunk: he squeaked.  Mrs. Meadow Mouse gave a sort of grunt.  "Humph! You wouldn't know him if you saw him," she retorted. "Besides,  he could see you long before you could see him, for his eyes are  wonderfully keen." Then she gave her son a poke that sent him into the  tunnel and bouncing down upon the soft nest at the bottom of it. "You  stay there until I come home again!" she called. "Do you want to go  where your two brothers and your three sisters went?"  Mrs. Meadow Mouse did not wait for her
