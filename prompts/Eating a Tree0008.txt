Outline: In a hard winter, food becomes scarce and animals must steal from Farmer Green's farmyard to survive. Master Meadow Mouse is advised by his cousin to get more food, and is directed to the orchard. His cousin tells him to eat the bark of the trees, and Master Meadow Mouse does so, finding it a filling meal. However, Farmer Green is displeased when he sees the damage to his trees.

Story so far: Master Meadow Mouse is struggling to find enough food to eat, as the snow makes it difficult to access his stored supply. He promises himself to be better prepared in the future, but for now, he must rely on his cousins for help. Master Meadow Mouse seeks his cousin's advice on where to find more food, and is directed to the orchard. However, the cousin hurries away before Meadow Mouse can ask any more questions. Master Meadow Mouse eventually catches up to the cousin and expresses his frustration at being left behind. Master Meadow Mouse's cousin tells him that there will be trees to eat in the orchard, and then runs off. Master Meadow Mouse is confused, because he has never eaten a tree before. Master Meadow Mouse lets his cousin go after chasing him, and then heads to Farmer Green's orchard to eat. He feels that the winter is not as hard as he thought, but Farmer Green disagrees.

Last chunk: orchard one day, later, and saw tree after tree ruined, he was very,  very much displeased.  "I ought to have put wire netting around those young trees," he told the  hired man. "This is what comes of a hard winter."  [Illustration]      [Illustration]
