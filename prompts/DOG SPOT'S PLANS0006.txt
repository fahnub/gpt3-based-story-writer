Outline: Spot, an old dog, doesn't like Miss Kitty Cat from the moment he meets her. He plans to chase her whenever he can, but is careful not to do so inside the farmhouse. Miss Kitty is also careful to stay away from Spot, knowing that he will try to bully her.

One day, Miss Kitty is taking a nap in a chair near a window when Spot sees his opportunity. He sneaks up on her, but she wakes up in time to escape. Spot is disappointed, but Miss Kitty is relieved.

Story so far:  The new cat likes to curl up and dream, while old dog Spot plans to have some fun with her.

Last chunk: fed and well warmed she liked nothing better than to  curl herself up and doze and dream.  Meanwhile old dog Spot was telling everybody in the farmyard about the  new cat and the fun he intended to have with her.  "There'll be lively times around here when she comes outside the house,"  he chuckled.
