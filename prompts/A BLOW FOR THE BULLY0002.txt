Outline: Jasper Jay is a blue-coated bully who has a problem with people being too quiet. He especially doesn't like Mr. Chippy, a little bird who minds his own business and doesn't make a lot of noise. One day, Jasper decides to fly over to the stone wall where Mr. Chippy lives and tell him what he thinks of him.

Mr. Chippy emerges from the wild grapevine he lives in, and Jasper immediately starts in on him, telling him he's too quiet and needs to be more outgoing and happy. Mr. Chippy tries to please Jasper, but he's so upset that he can only manage a feeble "chip, chip, chip, chip."

Jasper gets angry and threatens to break every bone in Mr. Chippy's body if he doesn't start laughing. Mr. Chippy decides he's had enough, and with one swift movement, he knocks Jasper off the stone wall and back into the grass.

Jasper is furious, but Mr. Chippy has already dived back under the cover of the grapevine and is hiding between the stones. Jasper gives up and flies off, grumbling to himself. As he does, he thinks he hears a peculiar noise coming from the depths of the grapevine. It's Mr. Chippy, chuckling to himself.

Story so far:  Mr. Chippy is a helpful bird who clears the crumbs off Farmer Green's wife's doorstep. Jasper Jay complains that Mr. Chippy is too humble and quiet.

Last chunk: he was never known to do anybody the least bit of harm. On the  contrary, he was quite helpful to Farmer Green's wife, for he went to  the farmhouse almost every day and cleared the crumbs off the kitchen  doorstep.  But Jasper Jay complained that Mr. Chippy was altogether too humble.  "He never says anything except '_Chip, chip, chip, chip_,'" Jasper often  remarked. "And his voice is so high and thin that anybody would think he  was a little old lady, to hear him. He's too quiet to get on in
