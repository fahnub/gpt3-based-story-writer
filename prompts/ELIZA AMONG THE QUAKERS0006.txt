Outline: Eliza and her son are travelling north to Canada to escape slavery. Along the way, they are helped by kind people, including a group of Quakers. The Quakers are gentle, quiet people who dress alike in plain grey clothes. They are opposed to slavery and often help slaves who have escaped from their masters.

The Quakers are fond of Eliza and would like her to stay with them, but she is determined to keep going. She is afraid that her slave owner will find her and take her back.

That night, Eliza's husband George arrives. He has escaped from slavery and has come to find his wife and son. Eliza is overjoyed to see him and they spend the night together. The next morning, they continue their journey to Canada.

Story so far:  A runaway slave is told by a kind Quaker woman that she will be safe in their village. When the woman's husband comes to the door, he tells her that the slave's husband is on his way. Eliza, a kind Quaker woman, helps slaves who have escaped their cruel masters, even though she knows she will be punished for it. She cannot rest or sleep at night because she is haunted by the fear that the slaveholders will find her and take her back. Eliza falls asleep and has a pleasant dream in which she is told her home is a beautiful country with green shores, pleasant islands, and lovely glittering water. The woman wakes up from a happy dream to find that it has become reality: her husband is holding her in his arms and crying tears of joy.

Last chunk: playing happily. She heard her husband's footstep. She felt him coming nearer. His arms were around her, his tears falling upon her face, and she awoke.  It was no dream. The sun had set, the candles were lit. Harry was sleeping by her side, and George, her husband, was holding her in his arms.
