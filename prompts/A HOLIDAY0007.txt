Outline: The little village in the pond is excited when Brownie Beaver returns with the news that hunting and fishing will no longer be allowed. Grandaddy Beaver suggests they take a holiday to celebrate and everyone agrees. They plan swimming races and tree-felling contests. Brownie Beaver is voted to go down to Pleasant Valley to thank Farmer Green for putting the notice on the tree.

The swimming races cause some trouble when a young scamp called Slippery Sam wins the last race. Many people think he cheated by swimming up inside his house to get air, but no one can prove it.

The tree-felling contest is also problematic, with some people complaining that their trees are harder to gnaw than others. Old Mr. Crow hears the noise from miles away and comes to see what is happening.

When Mr. Crow learns about the celebration, he laughs and tells them that they will never see Brownie Beaver again. He explains that it was not Farmer Green who put up the notice, but his son Johnnie. Johnnie only wants hunting and fishing for himself and it will be more dangerous than ever. Brownie Beaver immediately resigns from his position and nobody else wants to go, so the whole village is disappointed. Grandaddy Beaver makes a short speech reminding them that they've all had a good holiday and that is something to be thankful for.
