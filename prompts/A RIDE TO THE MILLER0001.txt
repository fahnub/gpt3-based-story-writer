Outline: Johnnie Green and his grandmother are on their way to the miller's with a sack of wheat when they are joined by an unexpected passenger - Sandy Chipmunk. Sandy has stowed away in the sack of wheat and begins to eat his fill, intending to take the rest of the wheat home with him. However, before he can finish his meal, the sack is tied up and he is forced to ride along in the wagon, cowering in fear.

The ride is a bumpy one, and Sandy is terrified the whole way. Eventually, the wagon hits a bump and Grandmother Green screams. Johnnie begins to cry, and Sandy is even more scared. He has no idea what is happening.

Johnnie Green and his grandmother are talking near Sandy, which scares him even more. Suddenly, the wagon lurches forward and Grandmother screams. Farmer Green gives Johnnie the reins to the wagon and they start down the road to the miller's. Sandy Chipmunk, who is cowering inside a bag in the wagon, thinks the ride is very bumpy. Sandy Chipmunk stole a bag of wheat from Farmer Green's wagon and ate some of the wheat kernels. Johnnie Green, his grandmother, and Sandy Chipmunk go to the miller's with a sack of wheat to be ground.
