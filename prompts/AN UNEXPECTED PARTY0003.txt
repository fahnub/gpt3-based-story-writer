Outline: Nimble's mother is taking him to Farmer Green's carrot patch to have his first taste of carrots. However, she is surprised and dismayed to find that dozens of other forest folk are also coming along. She tries to send them all away, but Nimble begs her to let them stay.

She reluctantly agrees, but is worried about old dog Spot. Sure enough, Spot starts barking and chasing them all around the farm. They all finally escape and Nimble's mother is very angry with him.

However, the other animals are all very excited about the adventure and say they'll come back anytime Nimble's mother wants. She tells them it won't be anytime soon, and they all go their separate ways.

Story so far:  The mother of Nimble the deer tells him that he can go to the garden any night, and Jimmy Rabbit whispers to Nimble that he should let Jimmy know when he goes so that Jimmy can come too. Nimble's mother does not want company when taking him to the carrot patch for the first time, but does not want to be impolite by telling them to go away.

Last chunk: "They said they'd like to come," he told his mother. "And I said maybe  you wouldn't mind."  "Well, I do mind," she declared firmly. "When I take a child to the  carrot patch for the first time I don't want company. One of this crowd  is more than likely to rouse old dog Spot. And we can't have him  ranging around while we're dining."  "Then tell everybody to go home!" Nimble suggested. "Tell them to go  'way!"  "No!" said his mother. "That wouldn't be polite."  She was silent for a few moments.
