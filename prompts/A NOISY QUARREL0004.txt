Outline: The Hermit Thrush decides to settle a dispute between his cousins, old Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay, by arranging a race between Bobby Bobolink and Benjamin Bat. The two birds are known for their respective talents - Bobby Bobolink is an agile flier, while Benjamin Bat is known for being able to travel long distances.

The Hermit Thrush first tries to persuade Benjamin Bat to change his habits and stay awake during the day, but when that doesn't work, he asks Bobby Bobolink to stay up at night. In the end, both birds agree to the race.

The race is held, and to everyone's surprise, Bobby Bobolink wins. Old Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay are forced to admit that they were wrong about Bobby Bobolink, and the three cousins reconcile.

Story so far:  The Hermit asks Jasper Jay and Benjamin Bat to let him speak to Bobby Bobolink, because he wants Bobby to stay awake some day to oblige him. However, the Hermit says that Bobby would probably sing his most boisterous song and wake him up, so it wouldn't work out. The Hermit proposes a race to settle a dispute between Jasper Jay and Mr. Crow.

Last chunk: Jasper Jay nor Mr. Crow was noted for his gentlemanly manners.  They both tried to explain at the same time. And it made the Hermit  wince to listen to their loud, harsh voices. He was himself a quiet  bird; his voice was very sweet.  "There's only one way to settle your dispute," the Hermit said when the  two cousins had succeeded in making their trouble clear. "You must  arrange a race between this Bobolink person and Benjamin Bat."  "Impossible! You don't know what you're talking about!"
