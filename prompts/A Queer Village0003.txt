Outline: Dorothy, the shaggy man, Toto, and Button-Bright are taken prisoner by foxes and led to the royal palace. The fox king questions them and is pleased to learn they are friends. The king tells Dorothy that everyone knows who she is and that she is an important personage since Princess Ozma of Oz made her her friend. The king also reveals that Ozma is going to celebrate her birthday on the twenty-first of the month and expresses his hope to get an invitation.

Dorothy is surprised to learn that they are not in Kansas anymore and that they have been transported to Foxville in Fairyland. The fox king tells her that she can return to Kansas if she wishes, but Dorothy decides to stay and explore Foxville instead.

Story so far: The shaggy man, Dorothy, and Button-Bright are presented to the fox-king, who is seated in a large, ornate room with stained glass windows. The fox-king and his court are described as being very grand and stately. The fox-soldiers are armed with swords with sharp teeth, and they have surrounded Dorothy and her friends. The captain is demanding their surrender. Button-Bright asks the fox-captain what a prisoner is, and the captain replies that Button-Bright is one. The Fox-King is surprised to learn that the girl he is talking to thinks they are in Kansas. He laughs and asks her if she has ever seen such a wonderful city as Foxville in Kansas. The little party trudged along cheerfully, with Button-Bright taking the shaggy man's hand. They were getting used to queer adventures, which interested them very much. Ozma is having a birthday party and the speaker would like to be invited. The passage describes a scene in which Dorothy and her companions are impressed by the bright colors and artistry of the landscape. Button-Bright is especially fascinated, and Toto is excited and wants to bark and chase the foxes he sees. However, Dorothy holds him back. The fox wore an expression of intelligence and had spectacles and a small, golden crown. A company of fox-soldiers wearing green jackets, yellow pants, and red boots and hats marched out of the arch.

Last chunk: the fox wore a  shrewd and knowing expression and had large spectacles over its eyes  and a small golden crown with shiny points on top of its head.  While the travelers were looking with curiosity at this beautiful arch  there suddenly marched out of it a company of soldiers--only the  soldiers were all foxes dressed in uniforms.  They wore green jackets  and yellow pantaloons, and their little round caps and their high boots  were a bright red color.  Also, there was a big red bow tied about
