Outline: Alphege, or the Green Monkey, is a story about a young prince who is transformed into a monkey and must find his way back to his human form in order to claim his rightful place on the throne.

The story begins with the christening of Prince Alphege, son of the King and his first wife. The King's second wife, a Princess of undeniable beauty, is jealous of her stepson and takes measures to get rid of him.

The Wicked Queen sends a trusty servant to the Fairy of the Mountain, asking her to devise some means by which she might get rid of her stepson. The Fairy replies that it is impossible for her to attempt anything against the young Prince, who is under the protection of some greater Power.

The Wicked Queen then plots to have the Prince visit his aunt, the King's sister, in a distant country. The Prince sets forth on his travels with his devoted governess and her husband, but shortly after crossing the border, he disappears.

A black monkey suddenly appears and tells the courtiers that the Prince will not be restored to them until they have failed to recognise him. The courtiers return to the palace and break the news to the King, who falls ill and dies not long after.

The Wicked Queen becomes Queen in her own son's place and rules with a hard hand. Meanwhile, the Prince's governess and her daughter continue to mourn the loss of their dear Prince.

One day, while hunting, the young King spots a little monkey of the brightest green and takes him back to the palace. The monkey is really Prince Alphege, who has been transformed in this strange fashion.

The Wicked Queen soon discovers that the monkey is really her stepson and plots to have him killed. The Prince's governess and her daughter, however, refuse to give him up and instead keep him hidden.

The Wicked Queen sends the King to the governess's palace to find out the truth for himself. When the King arrives, he is surprised to see his brother, who has been lost for many years.

Prince Alphege tells his story and is crowned King. He marries his governess's daughter and they all live happily ever after.

Story so far: Lady Godiva was an unpopular ruler who was believed to have killed Prince Alphege. After her son was loved by the people, she retired with her daughter. They found a monkey and, following the instructions of the Good Queen, turned the monkey into a prince using a magic green liquid and a jasper bath. The passage describes a meeting between the Prince and some ladies, during which the Prince tells his story of suffering in the desert and being helped by the Good Queen. The ladies then discuss ways to help the Prince take back his throne. The King and his suite arrive at the door of the person deep in conversation with Prince Alphege, and the person begs Prince Alphege to hide. The King says he knows the person is plotting against him and wants an explanation. Prince Alphege then says he is the one who needs to provide an explanation to the King. The prince is advised by a stranger to return home, and he eventually does so. The news of the prince's return greatly upsets the king, who then falls ill and dies. The queen is delighted by her son's new position. The King finds his lost brother and gives him the throne. Prince Alphege was hesitant to be separated from his tutor and governor, but his wife convinced him to go ahead with it. He was fourteen years old at the time and very handsome. The Prince disappears after drinking from a stream, and his followers cannot find him. A monkey then tells them that their Prince is dead.

Last chunk: shelter under a group  of trees near, and here the Prince complained of burning thirst. Luckily  a tiny stream ran close by and some water was soon procured, but no  sooner had he tasted it than he sprang from his carriage and disappeared  in a moment. In vain did his anxious followers seek for him, he was  nowhere to be found.  As they were hunting and shouting through the trees a black monkey  suddenly appeared on a point of rock and said: 'Poor sorrowing people,  you are seeking your Prince
