Outline: Johnnie Green and his grandmother are on their way to the miller's to get the wheat ground into flour when their horse, Ebenezer, breaks a strap on his harness and they nearly go tumbling down a hill. Johnnie finds a piece of string in his pocket to tie the harness back together and they continue on their way. When they reach the bottom of the hill, Johnnie's grandmother screams - she had felt something run up her back and jump off her shoulder, which turns out to be a chipmunk. The chipmunk had been in the sack of wheat and must have gotten in Johnnie's pocket when he was taking the string out. Sandy, the chipmunk, is glad to be out of the sack of wheat and sets off to find his way home.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green's grandmother reports seeing a chipmunk, and Johnnie is not interested. Johnnie's grandmother needs a piece of string to mend the harness, but Johnnie can't find any in his pockets. Johnnie Green's grandmother screams when the horse steps on stones in the road. Johnnie Green ties the harness together after his grandmother screams. Old Ebenezer had been pulling a wagon for many years before Johnnie Green was born. Johnnie tugged on the reins, but Ebenezer continued slowly down the hill. When they reached the bottom, Ebenezer looked at Johnnie as if to say, "I've brought you and your grandma down safely. Now you can get out of the wagon if you want to." Johnnie then jumped out. Sandy escapes the sack of wheat, but is far from home and doesn't know where he is. A strap on Ebenezer's harness broke, causing the wagon to roll down a hill. Despite Johnnie's grandmother screaming and Johnnie crying for him to stop, Ebenezer continued on because he thought he knew better.

Last chunk: Ebenezer's fault at all. You see, he was wearing an  old harness. And just as he was on the steepest part of the hill a strap  broke and the wagon rolled right upon his heels.  Now, many horses would have kicked and run, if such a thing had happened  to them. But even when Johnnie's grandmother screamed, old Ebenezer was  not at all frightened. And even when Johnnie cried "Whoa! whoa!" Ebenezer  did not stop. He thought he knew a good deal more about what he ought to  do than Johnnie Green did,
