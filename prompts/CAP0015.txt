Outline: At the bottom of the sea, in an enchanted castle, lives the magician Zog with his many slave captives. Among them are two old sailors, Cap'n Joe and Cap'n Bill. Cap'n Bill is surprised to find that his long-lost brother Joe looks just like him, down to the wooden leg.

The two chat and catch up on old times. Cap'n Joe tells them that as a slave of Zog, he mostly just sews buttons back on the magician's clothes (which he busts off in fits of anger). He also warns them that there is no escape from the castle.

Later, they meet Sacho, a small boy slave who is full of information. He tells them that the only way to escape is to find the key to the front door, which is hidden somewhere in the castle. He also tells them about Zog's evil deeds, and how he brings sunken ship treasures back to the castle.

Cap'n Bill and Trot resolve to find the key and escape. They have many adventures along the way, including narrowly avoiding being turned into stone statues by Zog. They finally find the key, but are caught by Sacho before they can use it.

Sacho helps them escape and leads them to a small boat. They are pursued by Zog and his sea devils, but make it to the surface and back to land. They live happily ever after, with Sacho as their loyal friend.

There is a bell cord that Cap'n Bill doesn't know is a bell cord, and a ghost of himself tells him that he rang it. Brownie Beaver is embarrassed after being caught by a falling tree. The passage also describes how Captain Kidd and the army are trying to move a stepladder, but it's too heavy. Cap'n Bill runs into Cap'n Joe, who is wearing a wooden leg. Cap'n Joe is happy to have run into Cap'n Bill, as he has often wondered what became of him. Cap'n Joe enjoys living under water and finds more dangers floating on water than soaking in it. A soldier ant walks through an army of ants, and the soldiers are powerless to stop him. General Antenna is pleased and gives Captain Kidd a hearty slap on the back. The passage tells the story of an army of ants using stepladders to reach and attack Daddy Longlegs. Captain Kidd is ordered by the General to do the same, but is too scared to follow through. The passage describes how Cap'n Bill is like a fish in some ways, but he will not have gills when he returns to land. He also has a wooden leg, just like Cap'n Joe.

Last chunk: like a fish as Cap'n Bill does," observed  Trot.  "P'raps not," said Cap'n Joe, "but I notice Bill ain't got any gills  an' breathes like you an' the mermaids does. When he gets back to  land, he'll have his two legs again an' live in comfort breathin'  air."  "I won't have two legs," asserted Cap'n Bill, "for when I'm on earth  I'm fitted with one wooden leg, jes' the same as you are, Joe."  "Oh, I hadn't heard o' that, Bill, but I'm not surprised," replied  Brother Joe. "Many a sailor gets to
