Outline: Chil is a good friend to everybody, but he is a cold-blooded creature at heart. He sings a song about the end of the fight, in which he and his friends killed many animals. He laments the death of his friends, but comforts them by saying that they are now fed.

Story so far:  This passage is a poem about a child's birthday. The child says that they would rather be four years old than any other age, because it is the nicest age to be. The child loves their family, and their family loves them back. This passage is about the speaker's companions who have died, and how he now plans to comfort them.

Last chunk: that overbore.     Here's an end of every trail--they shall not follow more.     These were my companions. Pity 'twas they died!       (For Chil! Look you, for Chil!)     Now come I to comfort them that knew them in their pride.       (Chil! Vanguards of Chil!)     Tattered flank and sunken eye, open mouth and red,     Locked and lank and lone they lie, the dead upon their dead.     Here's an end of every trail--and here my hosts are fed.
