Outline: Benny Badger is searching for a ground squirrel hole to dig when he finds one that is recent. He debates on whether or not to tell Mr. Coyote, his helper, and decides against it. Mr. Coyote, sly as he is, has been following Benny and calls out to him. They both know that the owner of the hole, the ground squirrel, is home. Benny offers to let Mr. Coyote dig while he watches, but Mr. Coyote insists that Benny should do the digging because he is better at it than Mr. Coyote. Benny agrees and starts to dig when Mr. Coyote moves a few steps away and says he will watch from the back door. Benny digs for a while, stopping every few minutes to listen for Mr. Coyote, but all he hears is a chuckle. Mr. Coyote is watching Benny dig while Benny tries to listen and dig at the same time.

Story so far:  Benny Badger is trying to catch a ground squirrel, but Mr. Coyote is following him. When Mr. Coyote suggests that the owner of the hole might be home, Benny generously offers to let Mr. Coyote dig for a while. Mr. Coyote turns down Benny Badger's offer to help dig a tunnel, saying that he would be disappointed not to do it himself. He explains that he is a better digger than Badger, and that he will go around to the back door and watch while Badger digs. Benny is waiting to hear Mr. Coyote's call, but all he hears is a chuckle. He's getting frustrated, but he doesn't want to make Mr. Coyote mad by saying anything. Mr. Coyote is very sharp and Benny will gladly help him dig holes. Mr. Coyote and Benny Badger agree that Mr. Coyote will watch Benny Badger dig and that it wouldn't be fair for one of them to do less work than the other.

Last chunk: comes out through his back door, please call meat once!" he cried.  Mr. Coyote nodded his head over his shoulder and smiled.  "I will," he agreed. "And I'll ask you not to forget to dig hard,because you know I'll be watching hard. And it wouldn't be fair for oneof us to do less work than the other."  Benny Badger replied that in his opinion Mr. Coyote's statement was inevery way reasonable.  And then he began to dig.  Benny would have made better time had he not stopped every few minutesto
