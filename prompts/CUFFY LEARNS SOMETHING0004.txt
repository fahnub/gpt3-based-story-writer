Outline: Cuffy Bear learns that there is such a thing as maple-sugar and that it tastes a hundred times better than the sweet sap from a sugar-maple tree. He also learns that he must stay away from men, especially Farmer Green.

Story so far:  Cuffy finds a sugar-maple tree and falls asleep. His father comes home and tells them all about maple-sugar. This passage describes how bears can find maple syrup by finding trees with buckets attached to them. Mr. Bear warns Cuffy not to go near the trees because Farmer Green collects the sap every day.

Last chunk: and boil  it until it turned to maple-sugar. If Cuffy had gone further down the  mountainside he would have found a great many other trees, each--like  the one he discovered--with a tin bucket hanging on it to catch the  sweet sap.  "So you see there are many things for little bears to learn," Mr. Bear  said, when he had finished. "And the one _big_ lesson you must learn is  to keep away from men. Farmer Green visits those trees every day to  gather the sap. So you must not go down there again."
