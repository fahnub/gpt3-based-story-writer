Story so far: The animals are planning to kill the wolf-child Mowgli, but Mowgli is not ready yet. Buldeo killed one of his own buffaloes after mistaking it for the Devil-child, and the village plans to torture and burn Messua and her husband for being the child's parents.

They say that Hathi is the master of the jungle, and should be respected as such. Mang the Bat tells Mowgli that the village is buzzing like a hornet's nest, and Mowgli chuckles, saying that he threw a big stone into it. Mowgli sees Buldeo, an old man, running up a trail with a musket on his shoulder. He thinks to himself that this is what comes of living with the Man-Pack ( humans).

You will remember that
