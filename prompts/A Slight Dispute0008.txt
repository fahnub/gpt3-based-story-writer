Outline: Jimmy Rabbit is a tooth puller who lives in a hollow stump. Uncle Jerry Chuck comes to him to have a tooth pulled, but doesn't want to pay. Jimmy tells him it will be an ear of corn for the tooth, and Uncle Jerry agrees. Jimmy pulls the tooth and Uncle Jerry demands his ear of corn. When Jimmy tells him he just wants his tooth back, Uncle Jerry is so confused he goes home without another word.

Story so far:  Uncle Jerry is grumpy because he has a toothache, and Jimmy Rabbit is trying to pull the tooth out. The tooth eventually comes out, and Uncle Jerry is relieved. Jimmy Rabbit is surprised when Uncle Jerry Chuck asks for his ear of corn, since he thought Uncle Jerry would be the one paying. Jimmy Rabbit tricks Uncle Jerry into thinking he still has his tooth, and thus gets an ear of corn from him.

Last chunk: louder, until he was shouting at the top of his  lungs.  Then Jimmy Rabbit had an idea. He picked up Uncle Jerry's tooth off the  floor and placed it in Uncle Jerry's hand.  "There's your tooth!" he cried. "I don't want it!"  "But you promised to give me an ear of corn for my tooth!" said Uncle  Jerry.  "Well, haven't you got your tooth?" asked Jimmy Rabbit.  And Uncle Jerry Chuck was so puzzled that he went home without saying  another word.  [Illustration]
