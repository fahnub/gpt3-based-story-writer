Outline: The Frog family is singing a merry song when Timothy Turtle interrupts them, complaining that they are making too much noise. Ferdinand Frog tells Timothy that they will sing a special song for him, and the whole family starts bellowing their loudest. The song is about a grumpy turtle who is mean and cruel, and Timothy doesn't like it. He tries to drown out the noise by hiding in the mud at the bottom of Black Creek, but he can still hear the song echoing across Pleasant Valley.

Story so far:  Ferdinand Frog and his family sing about a grumpy one with a glittering, wicked eye and cruel jaws. The Frog family and Timothy Turtle are arguing because Timothy is making too much noise. Ferdinand Frog says that they only opened their eyes to make sure Timothy was doing as they asked, and Timothy Turtle replies that he can't trust them. Timothy Turtle is not interested in singing, but his friends sing a special song for him anyway.

And the whole company knew, when he  said that, that if he really cared anything at all for singing he never  would have spoken of it in that fashion.  They were just about to begin the song when Timothy Turtle stopped them.
