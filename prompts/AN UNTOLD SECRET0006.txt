Outline: Billy Woodchuck is excited to hear that Jimmy Rabbit is throwing a party and sets out to find him to ask a question. He runs into Nimble Deer who tells him that he is also invited to the party and is going to help Jimmy with something. Billy is worried that he will be stepped on at the party since Nimble's hooves are sharp, but Nimble reassures him that he is only helping Jimmy and there will be no fighting. The next time Billy sees Jimmy, he asks him what he is going to do to help with the party. Jimmy tells him that he is going to use his horns, but won't say anything else.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow told Billy Woodchuck that he would find Jimmy Rabbit and ask him a question, but only if Billy told him what the question was. Billy Woodchuck is pleased to hear that Jimmy Rabbit has a plan for the party, and wonders if he will be helping by entertaining the guests with a mock battle. Billy Woodchuck tries to find Jimmy Rabbit to ask him how to avoid the crowd at the party, but he cannot find him. Later, he meets Nimble Deer and asks him the same question. Nimble asked Jimmy Rabbit who would win a fight between two animals, and Jimmy Rabbit said there would be no fighting at his party. Nimble asked how he could help, and Jimmy Rabbit said he would use his horns, but not to fight.

Last chunk: said Nimble. "I  must ask Jimmy Rabbit who it will be."  So the next time Nimble found Jimmy Rabbit he asked him that very  question.  But Jimmy Rabbit said there were to be no battles of any kind at his  party.  "Then how am I going to help you?"  "You're going to use your horns--but not to fight," Jimmy Rabbit  explained.  And he wouldn't say another word.
