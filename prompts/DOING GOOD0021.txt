Story so far: A woman and her children visit a priest, who tells them about a treasure hidden by their ancestors. The children are excited to find the treasure, but are disappointed when they find it is just a carpet. The woman is speaking in a foreign language and ends with a question. Robert, who is holding the Phoenix, asks it to translate the woman's words. The children in the passage want to take their mother to see the Psammead, but they are worried about her reaction. An old woman, a young boy, and a lady went to visit a priest. The children have learned their lesson and will only use the carpet for good from now on. The speaker is asking whose castle is on the hill, and the poor lady replies that it has belonged to her family for hundreds of years but that she will have to sell it to strangers tomorrow. The passage describes a scene in which two people are buried in the snow, like St. Bernard dogs. They are rescued by a third person, who leads them to a hidden panel in an old German town. The children are trying to open a trapdoor that is bolted shut. The Phoenix tells them to keep trying.
