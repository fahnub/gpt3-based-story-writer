The Scoodler on guard stood near the doorway, turning first his white  side toward them and then his black side, as if he wanted to show to  all of his greedy four eyes the sight of so many fat prisoners.  The  captives sat in a sorrowful group at the other end of the room--except  Polychrome, who danced back and
