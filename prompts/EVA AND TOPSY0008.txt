Outline: Uncle Tom is a slave who lives with his owner, Mr. St. Clare, far away from his home. He is not really unhappy, but he longs to see his family again. His little mistress, Eva, becomes ill and Uncle Tom grows increasingly worried and sad. The doctor is called and Eva improves for a time, but then her health takes a turn for the worse.

One day, Eva tells her father that she is going to die and she asks him to promise to free Tom when she is gone. Miss Ophelia, who has been trying unsuccessfully to reform the naughty Topsy, overhears their conversation and decides to give up on the child. Eva takes Topsy by the hand and leads her into a little room, where she tries to explain to her that if she is good, people will love her.
