However, instead of running away, Dickie Deer Mouse hangs around and calls out to Mr. Crow, apologizing for disturbing him. Dickie Deer Mouse is looking for a summer home and finds Mr. Crow's house. Mr. Crow tells him that his house is too small for both of them, so Dickie Deer Mouse runs away. Dickie Deer Mouse hears a rumor that Mr. Crow is moving to a new place, so he goes to visit him. Mr. Crow is startled when he wakes up to find Dickie beside him.

Last chunk: A STARTLED SLEEPER (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    Of course Dickie Deer Mouse ought not to have been so ready to believe  that stray bit of gossip about Mr. Crow. It is true that the old black  scamp had _talked_ about moving to a new place nearer Farmer Green's  cornfield. But his plan had gone no further than that.  He was sound asleep in his bed when Dickie Deer Mouse jumped down beside  him. And when Mr. Crow suddenly waked up it would be very hard to say  which of the two was the more startled.
