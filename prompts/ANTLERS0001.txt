Outline: Nimble, a deer, loses his horns and is sad, but he soon discovers that new horns are sprouting to take the place of his old ones. He is excited to show his friends his new horns, but he discovers that all of the other deer have new horns too. Nimble's new horns are antlers, with two points, and he is excited to show them off to his friends, particularly the other deer known as the Spike Horns. However, he soon discovers that the Spike Horns are all new deer, fawns from last year, and they are not impressed by his antlers. Nimble and his friend Dodger the Deer become known for their mock battles, which are quite realistic and exciting to watch.

Story so far:  Nimble loses his horns but manages to get through the winter without missing them too much. He eventually discovers that new horns are sprouting in their place.

Last chunk: ANTLERS (Fables:- Ages 0 to 3)    Although Nimble had lost his horns he managed to go through the winter  without missing them as much as he had expected. And in time he had  almost forgotten the pair of spikes that he had worn on his head the  summer before. Then, one day, he made a great discovery. He found that  new horns were sprouting to take the place of those that he had lost!  "Now I can have some mock battles again--when my horns get long enough,"  he thought. And then he stopped short.
