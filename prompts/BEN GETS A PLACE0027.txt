Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Meanwhile, a little boy is taken to Beastland by some animals, but he gets sick and his papa takes him home. The speaker is faint and hurt, but a girl has an idea to help her friend. Finally, Ben is scornfully asked by the squire if he could drive cows to pasture, but he replies that he could if he tried hard.

Sancho is happy because he thinks their troubles are over and he won't have to go foraging anymore. Betty is putting more wood in the stove. The passage describes the remorse of a person who has hurt an animal, and their resolve to never do so again. A man finds a horse and asks it where its mistress is. The horse neigs, and the man sets off to find her. The animals in Beastland decided to chase away Benjy, the boy who had been abusing them, by tying a tin-kettle to him. The passage describes a picture of some "queer" ships and men, with a crowd of Indians dancing on the shore. The reader is disappointed because the page is covered in ink and he can't make out what it means. Ben decides to ask the girls he knows for help in understanding the picture.

Last chunk: history, for the picture showed some queer ships at  anchor, some oddly dressed men just landing, and a crowd of Indians  dancing about on the shore. Ben spelt out all he could about these  interesting personages, but could not discover what it meant, because  ink evidently had deluged the page, to the new reader's great  disappointment.  "I'll ask the girls; may be they will know," said Ben to himself as,  after looking vainly for more stray leaves, he trudged on, enjoying the  bobolink's song,
