Cinderella goes to the ball and meets the Prince. They dance together and fall in love. Cinderella must leave the ball before midnight or her gown will turn back into rags. She flees and loses one of her glass slippers. The Prince searches for her and finds the slipper. He declares that the woman who can fit the slipper shall be his bride. Cinderella's step-sisters try but fail. Cinderella tries on the slipper and it fits. She tells her story and is married to the Prince. They live happily ever after.

Story so far: Cinderella is a young girl who is treated poorly by her stepmother and stepsisters. They tell her about the beautiful princess they met at the ball, but Cinderella shows no interest. A prince falls in love with a woman who loses a glass slipper at a ball, and he searches for her throughout the kingdom. He eventually finds her and marries her. The godmother of a young princess tells her that she must leave the ball before midnight, or else she will turn back into a pumpkin. The princess is overjoyed at the prospect of attending the ball and agrees to leave on time. Cinderella's godmother, who is a fairy, asks her what is wrong and Cinderella tells her that she wishes she could go to the ball. The godmother tells her that she will see to it that she goes. Cinderella goes to the ball, and her two sisters come home and are surprised at how late she is. Cinderella's step-sisters were invited to a ball thrown by the King's son and they were very excited. Cinderella had to help them prepare and she was not happy about it. Cinderella's mother dies when she is young, leaving her in the care of her father and older step-sisters. The step-sisters are unkind to her and make her work as a servant. They mockingly call her "Cinderella" because she has to sift through the ashes.

Last chunk: CINDERELLA (Fable, Ages 0 to 3)    Cinderella's mother died while she was a very little child, leaving her  to the care of her father and her step-sisters, who were very much older  than herself; for Cinderella's father had been twice married, and her  mother was his second wife. Now, Cinderella's sisters did not love her,  and were very unkind to her. As she grew older they made her work as a  servant, and even sift the cinders; on which account they used to call  her in mockery "Cinderella."
