Outline: Jasper Jay is waiting in the big oak for Mr. Crow to arrive. He sees no strange bird. And he is glad--because he does not want to meet him until Mr. Crow comes.

At last Jasper leaves his hiding place and flies beyond the barn, where he alights on the fence, to meet Mr. Crow. And very promptly the old gentleman arrives. He brought ten of his relations with him, too--all noisy and unmannerly fellows.

"Here we are!" cried Mr. Crow. "We've come to see you whip the person with the loud voice and drive him out of the valley." And all ten of his relations joined Mr. Crow in a loud, cackling laugh.

"What's the joke?" asked Jasper Jay.

"Oh, there's no joke at all--yet," said Mr. Crow. And he and his companions all laughed again. "Come around to the other side of the barn," Mr. Crow continued. "It's time for the stranger to screech, for it'll be noon before you know it."

So they all moved to another part of the fence, from which they could see the farmhouse. And no sooner had they settled themselves comfortably than Farmer Green's wife came to the doorway and held a horn to her lips.

Then came the loud blast that Jasper knew so well. He was so startled that he almost fell off the fence. But he was not frightened.

He was very angry, however. For Mr. Crow and his friends began to jeer at him.

"Fly at her!" cried Mr. Crow. "She's the bird that you're going to drive out of Pleasant Valley. And we all want to see you do it."

It was very uncomfortable for Jasper Jay. He had mistaken the sound of the dinner-horn for the call of a strange bird. And he felt uncommonly foolish.

Since he dared not attack Mr. Crow, especially when his ten relations were with him, there was nothing Jasper could do except give a loud, helpless scream of rage and hurry away toward the woods.

"See those crows chasing that blue jay!" Farmer Green said to Johnnie, as they walked toward home. "Probably he's played some trick on them."

But for once it was not Jasper who was guilty. It was old Mr. Crow

Story so far:  Old Mr. Crow knows about everything that happens in Pleasant Valley. Green's wife came to the doorway and blew a horn. Jasper Jay was startled, but not frightened. However, he became angry when Mr. Crow and his friends began to jeer at him. Jasper Jay is looking forward to company, so he hides in a big oak near Farmer Green's house. He waits a long time, but no one comes. Mr. Crow and his relatives visit Farmer Green and tell him that they want him to drive the person with the loud voice out of the valley. Mr. Crow and his companions are laughing because they are about to play a prank on the farmer. They are going to wait until noon, when the farmer is taking his noon break, and then make a loud screeching noise.
