Outline: Uncle Tom is a slave who lives with his owner, Mr. St. Clare, far away from his home. He is not really unhappy, but he longs to see his family again. His little mistress, Eva, becomes ill and Uncle Tom grows increasingly worried and sad. The doctor is called and Eva improves for a time, but then her health takes a turn for the worse.

One day, Eva tells her father that she is going to die and she asks him to promise to free Tom when she is gone. Miss Ophelia, who has been trying unsuccessfully to reform the naughty Topsy, overhears their conversation and decides to give up on the child. Eva takes Topsy by the hand and leads her into a little room, where she tries to explain to her that if she is good, people will love her. Topsy is skeptical, but she is moved by Eva's words and she promises to try to be good.

Story so far: The speaker is discussing slavery and whether it is right or wrong. The speaker's child says that even if she is dead, the speaker should try to convince people to do the right thing about slavery. Uncle Tom is sad because he misses his family and because his little mistress, Eva, is ill. Miss Ophelia has tried to reform Topsy, but she remains naughty. Topsy tells Eva that she doesn't know anything about love and that the only thing she loves is candy. Eva is sad for Topsy and tries to find out if she has any relatives. Even though her loved ones noticed that something was wrong with Eva, Mr. St. Clare refused to believe that anything could be the matter with her. However, she eventually became so unwell that even he had to admit that something was wrong, and the doctor was called.

Last chunk: noticed it too, and tried to make Mr. St. Clare see it. But he would not. He loved his little Eva so much, that he did not want to believe that anything could be the matter with her.  Mrs. St. Clare never thought that any one, except herself, could be ill. So Eva grew daily thinner and weaker, and Uncle Tom and Aunt Ophelia more and more sad and anxious.  But at last she became so unwell, that even Mr. St. Clare had to own that something was wrong, and the doctor was sent for.  In a week or two
