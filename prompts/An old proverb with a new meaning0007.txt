Outline: The story takes place on a summer morning at a farmhouse in Prince  Edward Island. The farm belongs to Uncle Roger, and the house is full of  children: the narrator and his twin brother Felix, their cousins Dan and  Peter, and the orphaned Story Girl. Also staying with them are  relatives from out of town: Mrs. Patterson and her daughter, and Mrs.  Frewen and her sister, both with young daughters.

The children are in the kitchen, helping with the baking, when they're  joined by Felicity, who overslept herself. The Story Girl has already  baked the bread for the day, but Felicity is dismayed to discover that  she didn't let it rise a second time before putting it in the oven. The  bread is heavy and dense as a result.

The children are sent out to play while Felicity finishes the baking. They  discuss the Story Girl's mistake, and Felix tries to console her by  saying that everyone makes mistakes.

Later, company arrives: first Mrs. Patterson's sister and her family,  then some people from the town of Markdale, and finally Mrs. Frewen and  her sister from Vancouver. After tea, Mrs. Frewen and her sister want to  go to the Carlisle churchyard to visit their father's grave, and Dan  volunteers to stay home with Jimmy Patterson, the two-year-old son of  Mrs. Patterson, who has fallen asleep on the kitchen sofa.

The others go to the graveyard, leaving Dan sitting on the door-step  reading a book. When they return, Jimmy is nowhere to be found. They  search the house and yard, but he's nowhere to be found. They're  getting frantic when they finally discover him asleep under the sofa.

Everyone is relieved, but Dan is the hero of the day. The Story Girl is  a little jealous of Felicity, who received all the compliments during  tea. Cecily asks what "it never rains but it pours" means, and the  Story Girl explains that it means if anything happens, something else is  sure to happen.

Story so far: The passage describes a search for a missing child, which ends unsuccessfully. Dan and Felicity argue over whether the child could have crawled out of the door. The group of children searching for their friend Jimmy find only his skeleton. The passage describes Uncle Roger's reaction to his nieces' arrival, and Felicity's preparations for tea. All the honors for the tea fall to Felicity, who receives many compliments.

Last chunk: daughters of  the latter, arrived.  "It never rains but it pours," said Uncle Roger, as he went out to take  their horse. But Felicity's foot was on her native heath. She had been  baking all the afternoon, and, with a pantry well stocked with biscuits,  cookies, cakes, and pies, she cared not if all Carlisle came to tea.  Cecily set the table, and the Story Girl waited on it and washed all the  dishes afterwards. But all the blushing honours fell to Felicity, who  received so many compliments
