Outline: Henrietta Hen is in Farmer Green's garden, chatting with Jimmy Rabbit. Jimmy asks Henrietta if she's ever heard that eating too much cabbage causes long ears. Henrietta is horrified at the idea of having long ears, and Jimmy hastily leaves the garden.

Later, Henrietta runs into old dog Spot and asks him if he likes cabbage. Spot says he's never tried it, and Henrietta tells him that if he ate a lot of cabbage, his ears would probably grow longer. Spot refuse to try it, and Henrietta says that the joke is on him.

Story so far:  Henrietta Hen is worried that her husband's ears will get longer if he eats cabbage, but he insists that isn't the case. The speaker pecks at a cabbage-leaf and comments that the joke is on the person they are talking to.

Last chunk: she pecked at a cabbage-leaf, "I must say  that I think the joke's on you."
