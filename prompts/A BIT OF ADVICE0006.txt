Outline: Fatty Coon has been warned by Mr. Crow that Farmer Green is going to set old dog Spot on him if he doesn't stay out of the cornfield. Fatty is reluctant to stay away from the cornfield because he loves corn, but he is even more afraid of being caught by the dog.

Dickie Deer Mouse tells Fatty that he has managed to stay away from the cornfield by focusing on something else that he loves - deer horns. Dickie explains that deer horns can be found in the woods, near the foot of a tree.

Fatty Coon is immediately eager to try this new method and begins searching for deer horns. He is soon successful in finding some, and Dickie Deer Mouse is happy to see that his advice has helped Fatty stay away from the cornfield.

Story so far:  Dickie Deer Mouse is telling Fatty Coon that deer horns make a good meal, and that he should be able to find some in the woods. Fatty Coon is looking for something to eat, and Dickie Deer Mouse tells him where to look. Fatty is so excited about the prospect of food that he forgets to thank Dickie. The passage describes Fatty Coon's actions as he searches for deer horns under the trees. He is hoping to find something to eat, as he is very hungry.

Last chunk: the actions of his late  caller. The instant Fatty Coon reached the ground he began to look  under the trees--first one and then another.  "Don't miss a single tree!" Dickie called to him.  "Don't worry!" Fatty Coon replied. "I'm going to keep looking until I  find some deer's horns. And I hope I'll like 'em when I find 'em, for  I'm terribly hungry right now."
