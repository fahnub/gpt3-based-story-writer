Outline: The story tells of the friendship between a grasshopper and an ant, and how the grasshopper learns the value of hard work and planning ahead from the ant. The story also tells of the friendship between a swan and a gosling, and how the swan is saved from being killed and eaten by the gosling's singing. In both stories, the moral is that sweet words will never harm us.

Story so far:  The passage tells the story of a swan and a gosling who are kept in a yard. The swan is kept for its looks, and the gosling is kept for the cooks. They often swim and play together, but one day the cook takes the gosling and leaves the swan behind. The Fable of the Grasshopper and the Ant tells the story of a grasshopper who sings and plays all summer, while the ant works hard to store up food. When winter comes and the grasshopper has nothing to eat, she goes to the ant and asks to borrow some wheat. The ant agrees, on the condition that the grasshopper will repay her when the season comes around. A cook is about to kill a bird for soup when it starts singing a beautiful melody. The cook is so moved by the song that he decides not to kill the bird and let it go. This moral tale shows that sweet words can never harm us. The ant scolds the borrower for not working hard enough over the summer. The borrower then tries to explain that she sang all day and night. The ant is not impressed and tells her she must now dance.
