Outline: Fatty Coon is playing with Jimmy Rabbit and his brother when they get into an argument and Jimmy cuts off Fatty's mustache. Fatty has been looking for them for weeks to get revenge. He finally finds them, but they tell him they have the pink-eye and he should stay away. Fatty doesn't believe them and gets angry, but then he notices their eyes are actually pink. Jimmy tells him they're playing robbers and Fatty should be the robber. Fatty agrees and hides behind a tree. The Rabbit brothers never come back, and Fatty realizes he's been tricked. He becomes a laughing-stock among the forest-people, who constantly call him "Robber!" because of his black mask-like fur.

Story so far:  The Rabbit brothers tell Fatty Coon that their pink eyes are probably here to stay. Fatty Coon is alarmed and decides to stay away from them. Jimmy Rabbit and his brother have pink-eye and warn Fatty not to come too near them. Fatty asks if it hurts and Jimmy says it does and doesn't. As long as Fatty doesn't touch them, he'll be safe. A fable about a coon who plays barber-shop with two rabbits, and then meets them again later. He sees one of the rabbits behind a tree, and the other rabbit's long ears give him away. The Rabbit brothers play a trick on Fatty Coon, making him wait all afternoon for them. They never come back, and tell everyone about the trick they played. Fatty Coon becomes known as a robber, and Jasper Jay is the most annoying of all. The passage is about a man who laughs loudly and long whenever he shouts "Robber!" and everyone knows why he's laughing. Fatty is given the role of robber in a game of make-believe. He is to hide behind a tree and jump out when the other children walk by, saying "Hands up!" Jimmy tries to convince Fatty that he would make a good robber because of the black patch over his eyes. Fatty realizes that he had never thought of it before and agrees.

Last chunk: that Jimmy hadn't the  pink-eye. He would have liked to make an end of him right then and  there.  "What do you mean?" he shouted. "Robber nothing! I'm just as good as you  are!"  "Of course, of course!" Jimmy said hastily. "It's your face, you know,  That black patch covers your eyes just like a robber's mask. That's why  we want you to be the robber."  Fatty had slipped down his tree to the ground; and now he looked down  into the creek. It was just as Jimmy said. Fatty had never thought of it
