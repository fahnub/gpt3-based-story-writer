The next day, they are taken by Queen Aquareine to see the most interesting parts of the ocean. Along the way, they pass by many fierce and terrible creatures, but are protected by the Magic Circle that the queen has drawn around them. They visit King Anko, the sea serpent, and then return to the palace.

Story so far:  The queen protects Trot and Cap'n Bill from danger by swimming around them in a circle with her fairy wand. The passage describes a man and a little girl who are guests of the king.

The queen takes Cap'n Bill and the mermaids to the most interesting part of the ocean. The passage describes a mermaid looking at the fish through the glass roof of her palace.

Trot and her companions are shown to their rooms by mermaids, who are able to produce light from their bodies. Trot and Cap'n Bill enjoy a delicious meal consisting of many courses, despite some spillage from one of the lobsters. The little girl is entertained by the mermaids' singing and dancing after a feast. Cap'n Bill is bashful among the mermaids but is pleased when the queen offers him a seat next to her throne.
