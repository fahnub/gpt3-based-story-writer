Outline: Peppery Polly Bumblebee is stuck to a thistle blossom and asks Freddie Firefly for help. Freddie tries to go get help from the Bumblebee family, but they are all sound asleep. He has to make a decision to either go back to the clover field and help Polly, or go to the firefly dance. He decides to go to the dance and forgets all about Polly. The next morning, Polly's friends help her get unstuck and she looks for Freddie the whole day. Freddie hides from her and avoids the clover field and flower garden for the rest of the summer.

Story so far:  Freddie Firefly goes to the Bumblebee family home in the meadow to get nectar and promises to bring a fellow worker back with him. Polly looks for Freddie Firefly after her friends set her free, but he stays hidden.

Last chunk: Polly did not forget him. After her  friends set her free the following morning she spent the whole day  looking for Freddie Firefly.  But he lay very low. And all the rest of the summer he shunned the  clover field--and the flower garden, too.
