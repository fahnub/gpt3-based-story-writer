Outline: Trot and her friend Cap'n Bill are swimming in the ocean when they are suddenly surrounded by curious creatures called barnacles. The barnacles sing a nonsensical song about a man-o'-war and an anchor-ite, and Trot is unimpressed. The barnacles are harmless, but Trot is glad to swim away from them.

Next, they meet a group of jellyfish, which are much more beautiful. The jellyfish are delicate creatures that live at the bottom of the sea and are very sensitive to the waves on the surface.

Then they meet a sea pig, who is grumpy and complaining. The sea pig is bored with everything and everyone.

Finally, they meet a group of eels, who are very playful and mischievous. The eels like to scare the sea pig, and Trot is glad to be away from them.

Story so far:  The barnacles are singing a nonsensical song, and Trot thinks it's stupid. The mermaids quietly rebuked the guests for arguing and being noisy, and reminded them that the queen's guests should be more careful. The dinner provided was delicious, with lobster soup, fried salmon, and oysters, among other seafood dishes. The mermaid warns Cap'n Bill and Trot to watch out for the snapping eels. The eels are very active and can be dangerous. The barnacles sing about how they were attached to a man-o'-war, but it ran away and went to sea. They were then gathered up by a halibut and taken to topsy-turvy land. The mermaids' guests found the meal very satisfying, and there was no danger of them being hungry while they remained the guests of the mermaids. The meal ended with ice cream, which surprised the child guests, since they thought it would be impossible to get ice at the bottom of the sea. The passage describes a meal with unknown dishes, which the child is suspicious of. Cap'n Bill eats everything without questioning it, so the child decides to do the same. Trot and Cap'n Bill learn that the ice cream they are eating comes from icebergs. Trot is ashamed of how much she ate, but the queen assures her that it is okay. Aquareine then sends them out for a swim. The eels in the passage are discussing their plans to scare an old mermaid, and one eel says that they know how to be polite to company so they won't hurt the guests.

Last chunk: Bill.  "He is the guest of our queen," said Merla, "and so is this little  girl. If you do not behave nicely to them, you will surely be  sorry."  "Oh, that's all right," replied one of the biggest eels, wriggling  around in a circle and then snapping at a companion, which as  quickly snapped out of his way. "We know how to be polite to company  as well as the mermaids. We won't hurt them."  "Come on, fellows, let's go scare old Mummercubble," cried another;  and then in a flash they all darted
