Outline: Ben Brown is a young boy who has been traveling around looking for work. He is tired and hungry, and has been living off of scraps that his dog, Sancho, has been able to find. When he comes across Mrs. Moss and her two daughters, Bab and Betty, he is relieved to find some kindness. Mrs. Moss takes him in and feeds him, and the girls go around to the neighbors to collect some old clothes for him to wear.

The next day, Mrs. Moss asks Ben to tell her his story. He tells her that he come from a family that abused him, and that he ran away. He has been living on the streets since then, and is relieved to have found a place to stay. Mrs. Moss tells him that he can stay with them as long as he needs to.

The story ends with Ben happy to have found a new home.

Story so far: The passage describes a competition, a boy's abuse of animals, and a doctor's house visit. Ben is grateful for Thorny's friendship but feels sad because it comes so soon after another loss. Thorny is confident that Ben will win an archery competition against Bab, despite Bab having been taught by Celia. Ben is disconsolate after his dog dies, and Thorny tries to cheer him up. A child, who has run away after being beaten, is too tired to go any further. The passage describes a horse that has come back to its owner after running away and falling. Thorny goes off to try and find the lost dog, and half an hour later is roused by the sound of a hand-organ in the avenue. The passage describes Betty and Bab's love of horses and their desire to ride them. Betty is upset because the judge won't let them pull a few hairs out of old Major's tail to make rings of. The passage describes a scene in which a man is taking a nap in the grass, watched by children. Miss Celia comes out and talks to him in Italian, which delights him. The black dog had no tail, which Thorny found doubtful. Ben explained that if the dog were stolen, the thieves might have cut off its tail to prevent it from being recognized. This horrified Bab and Betty. The Lion asks the other animals what punishment they think Benjy deserves for making them tease and worry the cats and dogs, and they all agree to wait while he walks around and thinks about it.

Last chunk: that Benjy had made him tease and worry the  cats and dogs so often that he had quite learned to like it. All the  beasts were very angry at this, and said that Benjy must be punished.  The Lion said that he did not know just then what was best to be done  with Benjy, so he asked the beasts if they would wait till he had walked  around and thought about it. They said yes, so he walked around the  circle seven times, lashing his tail in the grandest way; then he took  his seat again and said:&&
