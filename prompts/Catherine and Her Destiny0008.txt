Outline: Catherine is a young girl who is visited by her destiny, who tells her that she must choose between a happy youth or a happy old age. Catherine chooses the latter, and as a result, her life is full of trials and tribulations. However, she is eventually rewarded for her sufferings when she meets the king and he makes her his queen.

Story so far:  Catherine is told by her lady that she must daily climb a mountain and offer freshly baked bread to her lady's Destiny. Catherine gladly does this, and the years go by. A woman destroys Catherine's belongings in a fit of anger, but Destiny intervenes and fixes everything. The passage describes a situation in which a king tries to weigh a silk ball against various objects, but the silk always outweighs them. The only thing that tips the scales is the king's crown. The king asked Catherine where she got her silk, and she told him it was given to her by her mistress. The king said that was not true, and threatened to have her head cut off if she did not tell him the truth. So Catherine told him the whole story, and how she had once been as rich as he. A poor girl is taken in by a noble lady and serves her well, but her destiny catches up to her and she is forced to leave.

And Catherine answered, 'Ah, my lady, I am very poor, and must go toservice to earn my bread.'  'I will take you into my service,' said the lady; and Catherine servedher well, and hoped she might now be left in peace. But, exactly asbefore, one day that Catherine was left in the house alone her Destinycame again and spoke to her
