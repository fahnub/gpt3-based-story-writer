Outline: Brownie Beaver is out walking in the woods, trying to forget about the impending storm that is going to destroy his home. He comes across a clearing where loggers have been at work, and he is so angry at the sight of all the stolen trees that he doesn't even remember the storm. He trips on something and realizes that it is a chain that the loggers have left behind. He hurries back to his village and uses the chain to save his house from the storm. When the storm doesn't come, he is so excited that he forgets all about the trees and goes to bed.

Story so far:  Brownie finds a chain and ties it to his house to anchor it down in case a cyclone comes. Brownie Beaver is angry because loggers have chopped down many trees. Brownie Beaver notices that all the houses in his village are still standing, even though his house was the only one with a chain around it. He asks Tired Tim how this could be, and Tim tells him that the chain must have saved the whole village. The speaker says that there was no cyclone and that the beaver is upset and won't talk to anyone. Brownie Beaver finds a chain that the loggers had used to haul logs out of the woods, and he hurries back home to use it to chain down his house and save it from the wind.
