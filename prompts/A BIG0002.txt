Outline: A big, fat potato dreams that he is the king of the garden and has to be obeyed by all the plants. He makes the radishes dance, the cucumbers sing, the cabbages grow, and the pumpkins blue. He strutted and sputtered and thought it was grand to be king and commander o'er all the wide land. But at last he woke up with an awful surprise and found a blind mole kicking sand in his eyes.

Story so far:  The passage describes a vegetable crowd being instructed by a sunflower on how to grow. The bright yellow pumpkins are painted light blue, and the scare-crow is made to buy new clothes. The person in charge is surprised by a blind mole.

Last chunk: sing    To a vegetable crowd gathered round in a ring.    He made all the cabbages stand in a row    While a sunflower instructed them just how to grow;    The bright yellow pumpkins he painted light blue;    Took the clothes off the scare-crow and made him buy new.    He strutted and sputtered and thought it was grand    To be king and commander o'er all the wide land.    But at last he woke up with an awful surprise    And found a blind mole kicking sand in his eyes.      [Illustration]
