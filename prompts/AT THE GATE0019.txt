Outline: The story is set in a monastery, where the monks live a life of prayer and contemplation. One day, they decide to choose a beggar from the outside world to be their porter, in order to keep the 'evil' of the world from entering their holy place. The porter faithfully does his job, keeping out all who would disturb the peace of the monastery.

However, one Easter Eve, the porter allows a sick old man and other needy individuals into the monastery, saying that it is the will of God. The monks are forced to put aside their prayer and contemplation to tend to the needs of these people. They are surprised to find that, in doing so, they are fulfilling their prayers more than ever before.

The story ends with the old abbot feeling the beat of wings, knowing that his time has come to meet his Master in heaven.

However, when true love is shed on those who are suffering, their cries are transformed into something that is heard and welcomed in heaven. The passage describes a man who, on Easter Day, decides to open the gate to his abbey to anyone who needs help. From that day forward, the abbey is filled with people seeking succor and healing, and the man's prayers are answered with more praise than ever before.

And from that day himself he kept the gate    Wide open; and the poor from far and wide,    The weary, and wicked, and disconsolate,    Came there for succour and were not denied;    The sick were healed, the repentant sanctified;    And from their hearts rises more prayer and praise    Than ever the abbey knew in all its prayer-filled days.
