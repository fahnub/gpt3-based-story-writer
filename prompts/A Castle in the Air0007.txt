Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is always on the move, and the latest place he decides to call home is in the cornfield. He is pleasantly surprised to find that many of his cousins have had the same idea, and there are plenty of shocks of corn for everyone to choose from.

Master Meadow Mouse settles into a huge shock of corn near the bank of Broad Brook and makes himself a nest of dry husks. He is content with his new home, and happy to have plenty of food stored away for when he gets hungry.

Story so far:  Master Meadow Mouse and his cousins are moving to the cornfield because they like the yellow harvest moon. Master Meadow Mouse is looking for a new home because he is cold. He sees Farmer Green building a house out of cornstalks and decides to build his own home out of cornstalks. The passage describes different mice choosing different places to live, depending on their preferences. Master Meadow Mouse found a place by the brook that he liked and decided to make his home there. Master Meadow Mouse is pleased to find a stockpile of ripe corn and sets to work building himself a nest from the husks. Master Meadow Mouse moves to the cornfield and enjoys the ripe ears of corn in the shocks. Master Meadow Mouse is pleased to see that Farmer Green has planted corn, as it will provide good homes for their family. Master Meadow Mouse is happy to be sleeping in a castle in the air.

Last chunk: order. Then he was ready for a nap. But first he made a  hearty meal of corn because--as he said--he always slept better on a  full stomach.  As he settled himself at last in his new quarters, just before he dozed  off Master Meadow Mouse murmured happily to himself.  "I never thought," he said, "that I'd sleep in a castle in the air."
