Outline: Johnnie Green has been to the circus and wants to try out some of the tricks he saw there. He first tries to get his dog Spot to jump through a hoop of fire, but the dog refuses. Johnnie then goes to the pasture and brings Snowball Lamb back to the farmyard, intending to teach her some tricks so they can join the circus next year.

It takes Johnnie a long time to teach Snowball to jump through a wooden hoop on command, but eventually he succeeds. He then tries to teach her to jump through a paper hoop, but she has difficulty with this. Johnnie decides to make a bigger hoop for the Muley Cow to jump through, but when he is milking her she gets impatient and smacks him with her tail.

Johnnie stops daydreaming and finishes milking the cow, then goes back to the woodshed and looks at the four paper hoops he has made.

Snowball baas in response, and Johnnie goes off to make some paper hoops. Johnnie spends the afternoon knocking old barrels apart and making hoops out of them. His father comes along and tells him to work harder, so Johnnie decides to make one more hoop.

Last chunk: rest of the afternoon, knocking old  barrels apart, chopping and sawing and hammering. He laid newspapers  down upon the floor and trimmed them neatly with his mother's shears. He  made flour paste in the kitchen. And when milking time came he had four  fine hoops all covered with newspaper.  Johnnie wanted to make one more. But his father came along and happened  to pick up a barrel stave, remarking that it was just the thing to make  a boy jump to his work. So Johnnie decided, for some reason
