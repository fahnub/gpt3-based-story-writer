Outline: Two cats steal some cheese and cannot agree on how to divide it. They decide to ask a monkey to arbitrate and he agrees. The monkey produces a balance and puts a part of the cheese into each scale. He says that one lump outweighs the other and takes a bite out of it. He then says that the opposite scale is now heavier and takes another bite. The cats begin to be alarmed and ask the monkey to give them their shares. The monkey says that justice is not so easily determined and continues to nibble at the cheese until it is all gone. He then tells the cats that what remains is due to him in right of his office and takes it all.

Story so far:  The Monkey is trying to divide up a piece of food between the two Cats, but they both want more than their fair share. The Monkey insists on dividing it evenly, but the Cats are not satisfied.

The  opposite  scale  was  now  heavier,  which  afforded  our    conscientious  judge  a  reason  for  a  second  mouthful.  "Hold,  hold,"  said  the  two  Cats,  who  began  to  be  alarmed  for  the  event,    "give  us  our  shares  and  we  are  satisfied."    "If  you  are  satisfied,"    returned  the  Monkey,  "justice  is  not;  a  cause  of  this  intricate  nature    is  by  no  means  so  soon
