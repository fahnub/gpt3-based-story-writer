Outline: Jasper Jay is a noisy, rowdy bird who loves to tease the cat and eat bugs and fruit. In the winter, he loves to eat nuts. He is especially skilled at cracking open tough nuts. Jasper is also a hoarder, and he likes to hide away nuts in different places so he can have a stash for the winter. However, he often forgets where he hides them and they end up growing into trees. Jasper is a rogue, but he is also helpful to Farmer Green in many ways.

Story so far:  The passage describes a squirrel's habit of storing nuts for the winter. The squirrel hides the nuts in different places, but often forgets where he has hidden them. Jasper the squirrel only likes to eat nuts, and is very skilled at cracking them open. Jasper Jay helps Farmer Green in more ways than one, but would never have guessed that himself. Jasper was a bold rowdy--but handsome--and he often visited the farm buildings, in the hope of finding a few kernels of corn scattered about the door of the corn-crib. Johnnie sees Jasper Jay eating frozen apples in the orchard and thinks about how the bird does better in warm weather when there are insects and fruit available. Jasper Jay also helps Farmer Green by eating moths that would otherwise damage the grapes. Mr. Crow's cousin Jasper Jay is even noisier than Mr. Crow, and he lives near Farmer Green's house.

Since it was his habit to spend his winters right there in Farmer  Green's young pines, near the foot of Blue Mountain, on many a cold  morning Jasper's ear-splitting "_Jay!
