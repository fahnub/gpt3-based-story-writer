Outline: Turkey Proudfoot meets the new peacock on the farm and is immediately intimidated by him. The peacock is much larger than Turkey and has a beautiful, full tail. Turkey tries to talk to the peacock, but he is met with silence. Henrietta Hen tells Turkey that the peacock is likely dumb and Turkey should be polite to him. The peacock then screams, startling both Turkey and Henrietta. They both understand that the peacock is not dumb, but his voice is so terrible that they can't understand what he's saying. The peacock tells Turkey that he is not a barnyard fowl and doesn't belong with the other farm animals. Turkey is hurt and angry by this, but he doesn't dare confront the peacock because he is so big and scary. The peacock walks away and Turkey is left feeling humiliated.

Story so far:  The peacock asked Turkey Proudfoot if he was a barnyard fowl, and when Turkey said yes, the peacock told him he wasn't. The peacock tells Turkey Proudfoot that he will probably not see much of each other, and then walks away. This upsets Turkey Proudfoot, who is tempted to attack the peacock, but decides against it because the peacock looks so big and strong. The peacock made a loud noise, startling Turkey Proudfoot and Henrietta Hen. A peacock is strutting around the lawn, showing off its tail with its many eyes. Turkey Proudfoot tries to stare it down, but eventually gives up. Turkey Proudfoot is mad that the peacock is ignoring him.

"You needn't pretend not to see me," Turkey Proudfoot gobbled. "You  can't fool me. You've a hundred eyes on your tail. And they've been  looking at me steadily."  The peacock calmly turned his head and glanced at Turkey Proudfoot. He  did not answer.  Turkey Proudfoot thrust his own head forward.  "Maybe I'm not good enough for you to speak to," he began.
