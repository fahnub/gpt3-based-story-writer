Outline: Mr. and Mrs. Moses Mouse are looking for something to eat in the cellar of the farmhouse they live in. They are complaining about how there is less to eat since Miss Snooper came to live there. Mrs. Mouse finds a box of potatoes and calls her husband over. They eat the potatoes and are happy.

Story so far:  A mouse named Moses becomes fretful after eating a good meal, so his wife goes to check on him. Soon after, he hears her muffled voice coming from inside a box, telling him that she's found potatoes. Mr. and Mrs. Moses Mouse are upset that there is less food to eat since Miss Snooper moved in. Mouse is tired of eating putty and wants to know what is in the box in the corner. Mrs. Mouse reminisces about the happy days when they would steal bits of cheese from Mrs. Green's cellar. Mr. Mouse sighs wistfully, recalling how skillful he was at avoiding the wire loop that could snap over his ears. Moses Mouse is upset because Miss Snooper has eaten all the sweetness from the sides of the cheese, leaving them nothing to eat for supper. His wife suggests they eat a chunk of putty instead.

Last chunk: little sweetness oozing down the side of it, is  there?" he asked her.  "No!" said Mrs. Mouse. "Not one! I suppose Miss Snooper has licked them  all clean."  "That disagreeable Miss Snooper has spoiled everything for us," Moses  Mouse declared. And for a fat gentleman he looked oddly unhappy.  "I don't know what we'll do for our supper," he whined. He always whined  when he was hungry.  "There's that chunk of putty that Farmer Green left in the woodshed,"  his wife reminded him.  "Ugh!" Moses
