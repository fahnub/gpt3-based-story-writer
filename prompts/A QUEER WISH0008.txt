Outline: Timothy Turtle is annoyed when he sees Johnnie Green fishing in his favorite pool in Black Creek. He watches as Johnnie catches three big fish, including the one Timothy was planning to eat for dinner. When Johnnie moves further up the creek, Timothy follows him, complaining to his neighbors along the way.

Peter Mink suggests that Timothy write a letter to Farmer Green, and Timothy agrees, telling Peter to find somebody to write it. When Timothy reaches the spot where Johnnie was fishing, he finds a string of seven pickerel that Johnnie has left there.

Timothy Turtle suddenly changes his mind about sending a letter to Farmer Green. He wishes that Johnnie would come there to fish every day. When Peter Mink meets Timothy the next day, Timothy tells him to go back and tell Mr. Crow that he hopes Johnnie Green will come twice a day to fish until he has caught every fish in Black Creek.

Story so far: Johnnie Green is a good fisherman who often catches more fish than Timothy Turtle. On one occasion, Timothy Turtle catches seven fish and leaves them for Johnnie. Timothy Turtle gets angry at Johnnie for catching too many fish and decides to follow him. Along the way, Timothy Turtle finds a quill that could be used as a pen. Timothy Turtle tells Peter Mink to tell Mr. Crow that he hopes Johnnie Green will come and fish in Black Creek twice a day until he has caught every fish. Peter Mink thinks this is a strange thing to wish for.

Peter Mink thought that that was a queer thing for Timothy to wish.  Neither he nor old Mr. Crow could understand it.
