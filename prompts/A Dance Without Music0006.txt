Outline: Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon attend a Rabbits' Ball without being invited. The guests are all blindfolded, and the dance is to be without music. Jimmy Rabbit, the host, is busy whispering to the other rabbits, telling them to take their blindfolds off and run away, because Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon are not supposed to be there.

Two by two, the rabbits take off their blindfolds and run away, until there are only three of the merrymakers left. Two of those are Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon, who are still dancing, still blindfolded, and each still thinking that the other is a rabbit. The third is Jimmy Rabbit himself. But he is not dancing. He is peeping out from behind a tree, and wondering what is going to happen.

Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon continue to dance, and the fat lady (Fatty Coon) steps on Tommy's feet. Tommy gets angry and tells her to be careful. Fatty Coon gets angry and tells Tommy he's a great, clumsy creature. Tommy retorts that Fatty can't dance any better than a coon.

Last chunk: pulled the mask  off Tommy Fox's face.  And again Tommy Fox was just as quick. He reached out and twitched away  Fatty Coon's mask.  For one second they stared at each other. And then they jumped at each  other.  Jimmy Rabbit didn't wait to see anything more. He felt that it would be  much safer somewhere else. And besides, the Rabbits' Ball had come to an  end.
