Outline: Mr. Frog is a tailor who lives by a creek. One day, he sees Mr. Crow flying overhead and calls out to him. Mr. Crow is on his way to the cornfield and doesn't want to stop, but Mr. Frog insists that he has important news.

Mr. Frog tells Mr. Crow that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler and that's how he makes his famous "Katy did, Katy" song. Mr. Crow is unimpressed and tells Mr. Frog that he won't be spreading this news around.

Mr. Frog is disappointed but Mr. Crow is unmoved. He tells Mr. Frog that he's not going to tell Brownie Beaver about the news either, because they've had a disagreement. Mr. Crow flies off to the cornfield and Mr. Frog is left alone.

Story so far:  Mr. Crow is wise and knows that Mr. Frog is not to be trusted. He decides to spread news about Pleasant Valley in his own way, without thanking Mr. Frog. Mr. Frog is disappointed but does not blame himself. The narrator's grandfather told him a secret, but only after he had eaten breakfast. The grandfather may have been in a better mood if the secret had been shared earlier. Mr. Frog is waiting for Mr. Crow to arrive so he can tell him some news.

Last chunk: A PAIR OF RASCALS (Fable:- Ages 0 to 3)    Mr. Frog reached home just as the sun peeped over the hills. He slipped  hastily out of the water, sprang up the bank of the creek, and in three  jumps landed on the roof of his tailor's shop. There he squatted, while  his queer, bulging eyes scanned the sky in every direction. He was  watching for Mr. Crow, and all but bursting with the news that he had  for the old gentleman.  Mr. Frog had not sat there long before he heard a hoarse _Caw, caw!_ in
