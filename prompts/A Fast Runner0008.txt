Outline: Jimmy Rabbit is known for being a fast runner, but Tommy Fox doesn't believe the hype. When Jimmy starts boasting about his speed, Tommy challenges him to a race from the creek to Broad Brook. Jimmy Rabbit is initially hesitant because he doesn't want to race a turtle, but he decides to go for it when Mr. Turtle offers a sled as a prize.

The next day, Jimmy Rabbit meets Mr. Turtle at the creek and they start off on the race. Jimmy Rabbit is confident he will win, but Mr. Turtle gradually starts to pull ahead. As they near the finish line, Jimmy Rabbit pushes himself to the limit and barely crosses the finish line first.

Jimmy Rabbit is exhausted but happy to have won the race and the sled. Mr. Turtle is a good sport about it, and they part ways as friends.

Story so far:  Tommy Fox refuses to tell Jimmy Rabbit who wants to see him, so Jimmy Rabbit goes to find out himself. He is surprised to find that it is Mr. Turtle, who then challenges Jimmy Rabbit to a race. Jimmy Rabbit laughs, because he knows Mr. Turtle cannot run. Jimmy Rabbit eagerly accepts a race challenge from Mr. Turtle, confident that he will win.

"It's a long way from the  creek to Broad Brook--a good day's journey, I call it. It's too late to  start to-day."  Jimmy Rabbit grinned. He knew
