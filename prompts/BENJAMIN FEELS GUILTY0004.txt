Outline: Benjamin Bat and Freddie Firefly face each other in Farmer Green's dark dooryard. Benjamin Bat tells Freddie Firefly not to bring Solomon Owl to his tree during the day, as he could be eaten. Freddie Firefly retorts that Benjamin Bat would be just as happy to be eaten by Solomon Owl as Freddie Firefly would be to be eaten by Benjamin Bat. This makes Benjamin Bat very sheepish, and Freddie Firefly knows that he is guilty. Freddie Firefly tells Benjamin Bat to leave and if he ever comes back, he will bring Solomon Owl to his tree. Benjamin Bat tries to get away, but is terrified of being burned by Freddie Firefly's light. Freddie Firefly is amused and dances around the dooryard. When he comes back, Benjamin Bat is gone and he is never seen again.

Story so far:  The speaker cautions against being careless, as it could lead to losing one's wings. Freddie Firefly scolds Benjamin Bat for trying to eat him, warning him that he will bring Solomon Owl next time if he tries it again.

Last chunk: Bat would have flushed with dismay, had he only known how.  "You're a rascal!" Freddie cried fiercely, flashing his light again and  again in Benjamin Bat's eyes, until that gentleman blinked so fast that  it seemed as if his eyes must be in danger of turning inside out.  "You'd better be off!" Freddie Firefly shouted. "And if you ever come to  me again, coaxing me to put out my light--so you can eat me--I'll  certainly bring Solomon Owl to your tree when you're asleep there."  Still Benjamin
