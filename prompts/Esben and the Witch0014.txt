Story so far: A man named Esben is captured by a witch and put in a dark hole, but his daughter eventually grows to like her captor and decides not to kill him. Esben's brothers say they can get him a special dove with feathers of gold and silver, but only if they are threatened with death. The king then has the brothers called before him and accuses them of lying. The brothers deny the accusation and insist that such a dove does not exist. SirRed is angry and jealous of the brothers, and plans to get them into trouble. He tells the king that they can get a lamp that will shine over seven kingdoms, and the king orders them to bring it to him.
