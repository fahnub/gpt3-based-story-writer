Outline: Mrs. Woodchuck is telling her Aunt Polly Woodchuck about the Muley Cow's new poke bonnet when they are interrupted by old Mr. Crow. He tells them that the Muley Cow is actually wearing a poke, not a poke bonnet. Aunt Polly and Mrs. Woodchuck are embarrassed and try to leave, but the Muley Cow calls them back and asks how they found out about the poke. Mrs. Woodchuck tells her it was old Mr. Crow who told her, and the Muley Cow says she'd like to have a talk with him.

Story so far:  The ladies gossip about Mr. Frog while Billy helps himself to a carrot. Aunt Polly invites her caller to come with her to see the Muley Cow. Mr. Crow told the Woodchucks where to find the Muley Cow, and they found her wearing a poke bonnet. A woman explains to her friends that she is not wearing a poke bonnet, but a poke (a sort of neck scarf). Mrs. Woodchuck went to Aunt Polly Woodchuck's house to tell her about the Muley Cow. Aunt Polly was eager to see the Muley Cow in her new poke bonnet. Mrs. Woodchuck said she hadn't seen it, but Old Mr. Crow had told her about it that morning. Aunt Polly Woodchuck and Mrs. Woodchuck notice a large wooden collar with a stake attached to it on the Muley Cow's neck. The Muley Cow is acting grumpy and snaps at them. Aunt Polly politely asks the Muley Cow to excuse them. Mrs. Woodchuck and Aunt Polly set out to visit the Muley Cow, but are waylaid by old Mr. Crow. He tells them that the Muley Cow can be found down near the lane.

Last chunk: Mrs. Woodchuck said that nothing would please her more. So she ordered  Billy to scamper home.  "You'll have to wait till I put on my best poke," Aunt Polly said. "If  the Muley Cow has a new one I don't want to call on her in my second  best."  So Mrs. Woodchuck waited. And at last they set off together to find the  Muley Cow. They hadn't gone far before old Mr. Crow flapped down on a  hummock near them.  "If you're looking for the Muley Cow," he squawked, "you'll find her  down near the lane.
