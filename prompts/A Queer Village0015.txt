Outline: Dorothy, the shaggy man, Toto, and Button-Bright are taken prisoner by foxes and led to the royal palace. The fox king questions them and is pleased to learn they are friends. The king tells Dorothy that everyone knows who she is and that she is an important personage since Princess Ozma of Oz made her her friend. The king also reveals that Ozma is going to celebrate her birthday on the twenty-first of the month and expresses his hope to get an invitation.

The shaggy man bowed, too, and Button-Bright  bobbed his head and said "Hello."  "Most wise and noble Potentate of Foxville," said the captain,  addressing the King in a pompous voice, "I humbly beg to report that I  found these strangers on the road leading to your Foxy Majesty's  dominions, and have therefore brought them before you, as is my
