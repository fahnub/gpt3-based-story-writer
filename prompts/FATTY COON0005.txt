Outline: Fatty Coon is a coon who likes to eat squirrels. The squirrels don't like him because he tries to eat them. One night, Fatty Coon climbs a tree in search of a squirrel to eat. He finds a hole in the tree and sticks his paw inside, only to be met with a sharp pain. He pulls his paw out to find that it was a tramp coon who had given him the pain. The tramp coon scolds Fatty and tells him to go home. Fatty goes home and never goes back to that tree again.

Story so far:  Fatty was looking for food and felt something sharp that gave him a dig. He saw that it was a cat's eye.

Last chunk: had, whenever he was  about to eat anything, or whenever he played with his brother Blackie,  or Fluffy and Cutey, his sisters; or whenever he was frightened. And now  Fatty was so sure that he was going to have a fine lunch that his eyes  turned as green as a cat's. He reached a paw inside the hole and felt  all around.  WOW! Fatty gave a cry; and he pulled his paw out much faster than he had  put it in. Something had given him a cruel dig. And in a jiffy Fatty saw  what that "something" was.
