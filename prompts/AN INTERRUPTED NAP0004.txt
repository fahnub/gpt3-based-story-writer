Outline: Nimble, a young fawn, sneaks away from his mother while she's sleeping and into the woods. He's careful not to make any noise and disturb her. As he's exploring, he comes across a fox perched in a tree. He's never seen a fox before, but he knows they're supposed to be sly creatures with bushy tails and long, pointy noses. He stares at it for a moment before realizing that it's actually a raccoon.

He hurriedly runs back to his mother to tell her what he saw. She's relieved that it was just a raccoon and not a fox, but scolds him for wandering off into the woods by himself. She teaches him that foxes are actually red, with no rings on their tails, and they don't climb trees.

Even as he spoke he burst into sight,  leaping the stone wall in such a way that his mother couldn't help  feeling proud of him.  "What's the matter?" she cried. "Who's chasing you?"  "Nobody's chasing me," Nimble told her. "When I saw the Fox I hurried  back here."  "The Fox!" his mother exclaimed. "Well, he won't dare touch you while I  am with you."
