Outline: Wandering through the woods, Fatty Coon's bright eyes catch a strange gleam from something that is shining and glittering out of the green. Fatty hurries to see what the strange thing is and finds that it is the moon! He is so excited that he runs home to tell his mother, and his brother Blackie, and Fluffy and Cutey, his sisters.

Mrs. Coon is puzzles and walks close to the shining moon to examine it. She realizes that it is a trap that has been set by Farmer Green, or his boy, in hopes that one of her family will see it and fall into the trap. Mrs. Coon hurriedly leads her family away from the spot and back home.

Story so far:  The passage describes Fatty Coon's discovery of the moon. He is surprised to see it so close to the ground, but he knows that it often touches the earth. Fatty claims to have found the moon in the woods and Mrs. Coon is skeptical but amused. Fatty finds a trap, and is glad he didn't start playing with it because then he would have gotten caught. Mrs. Coon hurries her family away and Fatty leads them home.

Last chunk: family would  see it and play with it--and fall into the trap. Yes--it was a mercy  that Fatty hadn't begun knocking it about. For if he had he would have  stepped right into the trap and it would have shut--SNAP! Just like  that. And there he would have been, caught fast.  It was no wonder that Mrs. Coon hurried her family away from that spot.  And Fatty led them all home again. He couldn't get away from his moon  fast enough.
