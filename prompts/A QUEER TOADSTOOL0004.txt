Outline: Old Mr. Crow is always careful to bring his umbrella with him whenever he leaves the house, ever since the time he got caught in the rain and got soaked. One day, while he's sitting on Farmer Green's fence in the rain, Jasper Jay and Frisky Squirrel both come and ask to share his umbrella. Then Fatty Coon comes and squeezes under the umbrella too, nearly pushing Mr. Crow off the fence. The weight of the umbrella and the three animals starts to tilt it, and Mr. Crow gets soaked. Suddenly, they all fall off the fence, and Mr. Crow is even more soaked. Christopher Crane comes and laughs at them, telling them he thought the umbrella was a toadstool. Mr. Crow goes home, coughing and sneezing, and decides he's done with sharing his umbrella.

However, Jasper Jay ruins his plans by crawling under the umbrella and getting close to him.

Mr. Crow is upset because he thought the toadstool he was sitting on was a new kind of plant, and he didn't realize that there were creatures living under it. Everyone else finds this amusing, but Mr. Crow is worried because he is already wet and he doesn't want to catch a cold. Christopher Crane laughs at Mr. Crow, Jasper Jay, Fatty Coon, and Frisky Squirrel after they fall off the fence. Mr. Crow asks Christopher what he finds so funny, and Christopher replies that the joke is on him. Mr. Crow was walking home in the rain when he decided something.

Last chunk: drier because they  were there. But he hoped no one else would pass that way.  Well, some one did.
