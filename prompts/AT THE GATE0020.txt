Outline: The story is set in a monastery, where the monks live a life of prayer and contemplation. One day, they decide to choose a beggar from the outside world to be their porter, in order to keep the 'evil' of the world from entering their holy place. The porter faithfully does his job, keeping out all who would disturb the peace of the monastery.

However, one Easter Eve, the porter allows a sick old man and other needy individuals into the monastery, saying that it is the will of God. The monks are forced to put aside their prayer and contemplation to tend to the needs of these people. They are surprised to find that, in doing so, they are fulfilling their prayers more than ever before.

The story ends with the old abbot feeling the beat of wings, knowing that his time has come to meet his Master in heaven.

Story so far: The passage describes the sound that God most loves to hear: the sound of people working hard. The speaker urges his brother to open the Abbey gates to God's poor, and to forgive him if he must chide them. The passage describes how the prayers of the righteous are sometimes drowned out by the cries of those who are suffering from injustice. However, when true love is shed on those who are suffering, their cries are transformed into something that is heard and welcomed in heaven. The passage describes a man who, on Easter Day, decides to open the gate to his abbey to anyone who needs help. From that day forward, the abbey is filled with people seeking succor and healing, and the man's prayers are answered with more praise than ever before. Only a lily now lies where the feet of the beloved once stood, and the old abbot feels the nearing beat of wings that will take him to meet his master.

Last chunk: there the Heavenly vision comes no more,    Only, each Easter now, a lily sweet    Lies white and dewy on the chancel floor    Where once had stood the beloved wounded feet;    And the old Abbot feels the nearing beat    Of wings that bring him leave at last to go    And meet his Master, where the immortal lilies grow.
