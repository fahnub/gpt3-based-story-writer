Outline: Trot is dreaming that she is at home in her bed, but she is cold and unable to move. She realizes that she is frozen inside of a block of ice and wakes up. She sees that the mermaid queen, Aquareine, is also frozen and realizes that their enemy, Zog, has frozen them while they slept. Trot decides that the only way to escape is to wait for the queen to melt the ice around them. The queen does so and they are able to swim to Cap'n Bill's room. They find that he is almost frozen and they have to rub him to bring him back to life. The queen and Clia decide that they need to leave the castle and they swim for the opening in the dome. They are followed by scores of sea devils, but they are able to make it through the opening and escape.

Story so far: Captain Bill and Trot are talking to the Queen and Princess Clia about the Arctic. The Queen and Princess Clia tell them that they can stay in the palace. Trot decides to leave the castle to find a way to help Captain Bill and the Queen. The Queen uses her magic power to melt the ice, and Trot and Clia rub Cap'n Bill's hands, nose, and ears to warm him up. After breaking a hole in a glass dome with a sword, a group of people swim through the opening and find themselves in an underwater castle. The Queen of the mermaids tells Trot that they will try to escape their captors, and that she is willing to risk everything for their safety. Trot is courageous and tells the Queen that she is ready to face whatever comes. Aquareine, the mermaid queen, is imprisoned in a block of ice, unable to move her arms or legs. Trot, a human girl, is also imprisoned in the ice, and she can see the queen clearly. Trot is dreaming and realizes she is cold, but cannot move to cover herself up. She tries again and wakes up. Aquareine calls to some fish, who then swim away quickly.

Last chunk: cried Aquareine, and in  answer to the command, the four whisked their glittering tails,  waved their fins, and shot away through the water at full speed,  their course slanting upward toward the top of the dome.
