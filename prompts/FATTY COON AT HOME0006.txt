Outline: Fatty Coon is a young raccoon who is never satisfied with the food his mother brings him. He is always looking for something else to eat and is always getting into adventures as a result. One day, he goes off in search of food and comes across a frog. He tries to eat it but it jumps away. Fatty gives chase but the frog is too fast for him. Fatty is about to give up when he sees the frog jump into a deep pool of water. Fatty knows he can't swim so he gets an idea. He finds a long stick and ties it to his tail. Then he swings out over the pool of water on the stick and grabs the frog. He is so proud of himself that he takes the frog home to show his mother.

They all live in the hollow branch of an old tree by a brook in the swamp. Fatty Coon was always hungry and would eat anything he could get his hands on, including bugs, snakes, and chickens. One day, after he had devoured all the fish his mother had brought home for him, he asked her if that was all there was. Mrs. Coon sighed, wishing her son would be content with what he had.

It was gone in no time at all.  Mrs. Coon sighed. She had heard that question so many times; and she  wished that for
