Outline: A young girl pleads with her pet cock not to crow before daybreak, promising him a life of luxury if he complies. She promises him a gold comb and silver wings if he will only be quiet. But the cock ignores her pleas and crows loudly, alerting the farmer to the coming day. The girl is disappointed but the cock is content.

Story so far:  A dame has lost her shoe and a master has lost his fiddle-stick, and they both don't know what to do. This passage is a nursery rhyme about a cock that is asked not to crow before day. If it does as it is asked, its comb will be made of gold and its wings will be made of silver.

Last chunk: COCK-A-DOODLE-DO (Rhymes:- Ages 0 to 3)  Oh, my pretty cock, oh, my handsome cock,    I pray you, do not crow before day,  And your comb shall be made of the very beaten gold,    And your wings of the silver so gray.
