Outline: Grandfather Mole is an expert at finding angleworms, much to the envy of Mrs. Jolly Robin. When Mrs. Robin discovers a greedy cowbird in her nest, she enlists Grandfather Mole's help in catching angleworms to feed her growing family.

Grandfather Mole agrees, but only on the condition that he be allowed to eat his fill first. This leaves Mrs. Robin scrambling to find food for her own children, until finally her husband agrees to help catch angleworms full-time.

In the end, Mrs. Robin is glad her husband doesn't have such a voracious appetite as Grandfather Mole.
