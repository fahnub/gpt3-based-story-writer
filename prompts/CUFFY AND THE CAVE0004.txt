Outline: Nimble, a young Spike Horn, befriends Cuffy Bear, a famous boxer who lives near Blue Mountain. One day, Cuffy invites Nimble to see his new home, a cave he's been eyeing up the mountain. Nimble is hesitant at first, but decides to go inside and wait for Cuffy while he looks around. As time goes on, Nimble starts to worry as the cave grows darker and snow begins to fall. He calls out for Cuffy, but there's no answer. Finally, he musters up the courage to go into the cave to look for him. Once inside, he finds Cuffy fast asleep. He wakes him up and they hurry down the mountain before the storm gets worse.
