Story so far: Button Bright and his friends are stranded on a mountain. Button Bright asks the Ork if he can see how his tail works, and the Ork explains that it is his tail and he reserves the right to whirl it himself. Button-Bright then proposes they go out and fly somewhere so he can see how the tail works. The Ork declines, saying he only flies when he is going somewhere. Cap'n Bill releases all the birds except for three, which Trot decides are the most beautiful she has ever seen. The Wizard of Oz presents the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion with gray clothes, which they use to make swings to ride on the birds. The Ork is their leader. Three of the bird-men agree to be transformed by the one-legged man, who assures them that the transformation will be permanent. The bird-men seem to want to be bigger for some reason. The old sailor ties all the birds together and fastens them to a stone so they can't escape. The Bumpy Man watches with curiosity and asks what will happen to the birds when they find they can't fly. The sailor replies that they may be a little worried but they won't be hurt if they take it easy. Cap'n Bill gave the Ork three berries, which caused the Ork to grow larger. Cap'n Bill captures several birds by tying cords around their legs while they eat. Toto begins to dig a hole, and Dorothy scolds him. Dorothy talks to a boy who is digging and discovers that he doesn't know where he came from or where he is going. She is surprised that he doesn't know anything and wonders what he will do next. A man tells Button-Bright that the large horns on his head were a gift from the fairies, and Button-Bright begins eating popcorn again. The snow has stopped and birds are gathering around the mountain-side to eat the popcorn. The Bumpy Man saved Button-Bright's life, and Button-Bright is grateful. The Bumpy Man explains that he is covered in bumps because he was once a popcorn kernel that was popped. The Bumpy Man does not know how to get away from Mo. Dorothy and the shaggy man discuss what will become of them. Dorothy admits that she does not know what will become of her, and the shaggy man laughs, saying that no one knows everything.

Last chunk: declared Dorothy, getting provoked.  "Must I?"  he asked, looking up in surprise.  "Of course you must."  "What must I know?"  "What's going to become of you, for one thing," she answered.  "Do YOU know what's going to become of me?" he asked.  "Not--not 'zactly," she admitted.  "Do you know what's going to become of YOU?"  he continued, earnestly.  "I can't say I do," replied Dorothy, remembering her present  difficulties.  The shaggy man laughed.  "No one knows everything, Dorothy," he said.
