Outline: Johnnie Green and his grandmother are on their way to the miller's to get the wheat ground into flour when their horse, Ebenezer, breaks a strap on his harness and they nearly go tumbling down a hill. Johnnie finds a piece of string in his pocket to tie the harness back together and they continue on their way. When they reach the bottom of the hill, Johnnie's grandmother screams - she had felt something run up her back and jump off her shoulder, which turns out to be a chipmunk. The chipmunk had been in the sack of wheat and must have gotten in Johnnie's pocket when he was taking the string out. Sandy, the chipmunk, is glad to be out of the sack of wheat and sets off to find his way home.

Story so far:  Johnnie Green's grandmother reports seeing a chipmunk, and Johnnie is not interested. Johnnie's grandmother needs a piece of string to mend the harness, but Johnnie can't find any in his pockets. Johnnie Green's grandmother screams when the horse steps on stones in the road. Johnnie Green ties the harness together after his grandmother screams.

Last chunk: Johnnie Green find.  Then he happened to think of the string his father had used to tie up the  sack of wheat. Johnnie stood the sack on end, tipped it against the back  of the seat, so the wheat wouldn't fall out, and unwound the string from  the mouth of the bag.  He had hardly begun to tie the harness together when Grandmother Green  screamed again.  The horse Ebenezer looked around once more, as if to say, "I wonder  what's come over the old lady."  And Johnnie Green turned his head, too.
