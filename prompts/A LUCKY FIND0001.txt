Outline: Brownie Beaver is out walking in the woods, trying to forget about the impending storm that is going to destroy his home. He comes across a clearing where loggers have been at work, and he is so angry at the sight of all the stolen trees that he doesn't even remember the storm. He trips on something and realizes that it is a chain that the loggers have left behind. He hurries back to his village and uses the chain to save his house from the storm. When the storm doesn't come, he is so excited that he forgets all about the trees and goes to bed.

Everyone agrees that Grandaddy is a fine, noble old gentleman, but they hope he is mistaken about the great wind. Brownie Beaver is happy he listened to Tired Tim and built a hideout in the bank, as his house would have been carried away by the big wind otherwise.

With no rope--or anythingelse--to tie the house with, Brownie could not see that Grandaddy'sadvice was of any use to him.  Anyhow, he was glad he had done as Tired Tim had suggested and dug ahouse in the bank, where he could hide until the storm passed. But hefelt sad at the
