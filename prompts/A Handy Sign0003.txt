Outline: Master Meadow Mouse is always being hunted by predators, so he decides to build a little hut near the fence between the meadow and the pasture. He hangs a sign outside his door that says "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow" on one side and "At Home. Don't Knock. Walk In" on the other.

One day, Tommy Fox sneaks up to Master Meadow Mouse's hut and sees the sign that says "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow." He decides to wait around and come back the next day.

The next day, Tommy Fox comes back and sees the sign that says "At Home. Don't Knock. Walk In." He sticks his nose through the doorway, but Master Meadow Mouse is nowhere to be found. Tommy Fox has been tricked by the clever Meadow Mouse and is very embarrassed.

Story so far:  The passage describes a creature that is annoyed at being tricked by a meadow mouse. It hopes that nobody ever finds out about the incident. Master Meadow Mouse lives in a good home, but it is not as safe as his old nest. To protect himself, he hangs a sign on his door that says "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow."

Last chunk: It was a good home. But it had one drawback. If anybody came along when  its owner was asleep in it--Well, Master Meadow Mouse didn't like to  think about that. The little nest at the end of the tunnel where he had  once lived had been far safer.  "I know what I'll do!" he cried at last, as a happy thought came to him.  "I'll hang a sign outside my door."  He set to work. And soon he had printed a sign. On one side of this was  the notice, "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow." And on the other side
