Then Curdie had to explain everything--how he had watched for her sake,  how he had been wounded and shut up by the soldiers, how he heard the  noises and could not rise, and how the beautiful old lady had come to  him, and all that followed.  'Poor Curdie! to lie there hurt and ill, and me never to know it!'  exclaimed the princess, stroking his rough hand.
