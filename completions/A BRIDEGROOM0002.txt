Daddy Longlegs cried, as a look of  pleasure crossed his face.  "I'm glad you think so," said Mr. Chippy. "It's only fair to tell you  that I thought of it myself."  And then he called for "three cheers for Grandfather Graybeard!"  They gave them with a right good will.  And after the sound had died away Mr. Chippy said something in a whisper  to Daddy.  "What is it?" Rusty Wren demanded. "What's he talking about?"  "He thinks we ought to give three cheers for him," Daddy Longlegs  explained.
