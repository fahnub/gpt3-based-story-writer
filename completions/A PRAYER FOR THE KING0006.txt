*    *    *    *      The Queen is dead. God save the King.    This is no hour when joy has leave to sing;    Only, amid our tears, we are bold to pray,    More boldly, in that we pray sorrowing,    In this most sorrowful day.    God, who wast of a mortal Mother born,    Who driest the tears with which Thy children mourn,    God, save the King!      Look down on him whose crown is wet with tears    In which its splendour fades and disappears--    His tears, our tears, tears out of all her lands.
