the noisome breed    Of flatterers who eat the soul away,    God save the King!      From loss and pain and tears    Such as her many years    Brought her; from battle and strife,    And the inmost hurt of life,    The wounds that no crown can heal,    No ermine robes conceal,    God save the King!      God, by our memories of his Mother's face,    By the love that makes our heart her dwelling-place,    Grant to our sorrow this desired grace:    God save the King!          *    *    *    *    *
