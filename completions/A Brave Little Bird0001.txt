frightened. But Mrs.  Squirrel was not at home. Frisky did not know what to do. He tried to  reach his home in the big hickory tree near-by; but Mr. and Mrs. Hawk  wouldn't let him go near it. And when he felt one of Mr. Hawk's sharp  talons dig into his back Frisky thought that his end had come. But he  escaped that time, though Mrs. Hawk nearly caught him just two seconds  later.  I am afraid _The Tale of Frisky Squirrel_ would have ended right here,  if somebody had not come to Frisky's help.
