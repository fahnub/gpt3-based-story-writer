Fatty Coon lived with his mother and his brother and  his two sisters. Among them all there was what grown people call "a  strong family resemblance," which is the same thing as saying that they  all looked very much alike. The tail of each one of them--mother and  children too--had six black rings around it. Each of them had a dark  brown patch of fur across the face, like a mask. And--what do you  think?--each of them, even Fatty and his brother and his sisters, had a  stiff, white moustache!
