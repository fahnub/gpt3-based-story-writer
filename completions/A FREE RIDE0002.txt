said Grumpy Weasel softly. "His yelping and whining  don't scare me. He can't get inside this jug of mine. And I certainly  shan't leave it so long as he stays here."  Meanwhile he could hear Farmer Green talking to old Spot, telling him  not to be silly.  "From the way you're acting anybody might think there was a bear around  here," he told Spot.  Old dog Spot explained to Farmer Green in no uncertain fashion that it  was no bear--but a weasel--that he was looking for. His nose told him  that.
