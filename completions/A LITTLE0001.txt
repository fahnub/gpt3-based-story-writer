my poor lad's first day! Whereshould I seat him? There was an empty space beside little Mike Higgins,but Mike's character, obtained from a fond and candid parent, had beento the effect "that he was in heaven any time if he could jest lay a boyout flat"! And there was a place by Moses, but he was very much of a fopjust then, owing to a new "second-hand" coat, and might make scathingallusions to Patsy's abbreviated swallow-tail.  But a pull at my skirt and a whisper from the boy decided me.
