not yet begun to beat for the day.  We paused a moment in the hall to look at the big "Grandfather" clock.  It was not going, but it seemed like an old, familiar acquaintance to  us, with the gilt balls on its three peaks; the little dial and pointer  which would indicate the changes of the moon, and the very dent in its  wooden door which father had made when he was a boy, by kicking it in a  fit of naughtiness.  Then we opened the front door and stepped out, rapture swelling in our  bosoms.
