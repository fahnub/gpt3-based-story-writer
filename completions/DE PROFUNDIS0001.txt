the foul fell it wore.    Though a thousand serpent heads were raised to slay,    A thousand twisting coils writhed where it lay,    There lies the beast, there let it lie for me    And agonize and rave;    For Thou has raised my soul, Thy soul, to Thee!    Thy soul, dear Lord, Thou hast been strong to save!
