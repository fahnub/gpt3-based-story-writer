beside Spot, Grunty Pig peered inside the cage. He saw a number  of odd little creatures running about upon the sawdust-strewn floor of  the tiny house, one or another of them giving a faint squeak now and  then as if ordering the two unasked callers to move on.

Yet he couldn't tell  just what it was.
