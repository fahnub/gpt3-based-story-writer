Mr. Crow to take your invitation to Jolly Robin in the  orchard and ask him to give it to you," Long Bill informed his  bewildered cousin.  "That's just the way this invitation reached me yesterday!" Rusty  explained.  "Ah! I see it all now," said Long Bill. And he began to laugh  merrily. "Mr. Crow's poor memory is to blame for your mistake. He  forgot to deliver the message last year. And he happened to  remember it only yesterday. So the news reached you just twelve  months too late."
