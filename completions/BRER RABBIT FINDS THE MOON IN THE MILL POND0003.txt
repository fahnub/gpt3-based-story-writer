Dey 'gree ter de day, an' Brer Rabbit say   Dat dey don't hatter come ef it rain;    [Illustration]    So said, so done, an' when de time come,   De big road ez well ez de lane   Wuz filled wid a crowd, all talkin' out loud,   An' a-prankin' wid might an' main!  Brer Rabbit wuz dar, wid Miss Molly Har',   A-waitin' fer de fun ter begin;   He shuck his shank, an' went ter de bank,   An' make like he gwineter jump in!  But de sight dat he saw made 'im drap his jaw,   An' break up a great big grin!
