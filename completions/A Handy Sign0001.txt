had finished building his nest there, Master Meadow Mouse  settled near the fence between the meadow and the pasture. The mowing  machine hadn't cut the weeds and grass that grew close to the fence. He  found shelter there from the sharp eyes of birds that would have caught  him had they been able to.  This time Master Meadow Mouse didn't live underground. He made a sort of  little hut for himself, which kept out the cold in chilly weather, and  shed the rain when it didn't pour down too hard.
