Bat made no move. Yet he wanted to go away because he was  in terror of being burned by Freddie Firefly's light. But he did not  dare turn his back upon Freddie Firefly and his light and fly away. And  he began to be sorry that he had never learned to fly backwards.  "Please--" Benjamin Bat stammered at last--"please do me a favor. I'm  not feeling very well. I'm afraid I'm going to be ill. Maybe you'll be  good enough to go and ask my friend Farmer Green to step outside his  house a moment.
