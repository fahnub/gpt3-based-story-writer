Shall serve you when you walk no more with me    In garden ways; and when with her you tread    The pleasant ways with blossoms overhead    And when she asks, "How did you come to know    The secrets of the ways these green things grow?"    Then you will answer--and I, please God, hear,    "I had another garden once, my dear".
